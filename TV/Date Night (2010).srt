1
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,954
Pap.

2
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:53,096
Mom. I get breakfast?

3
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:55,389
Honey, you do not move.
- Mommy, Daddy!

4
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:59,354
Get up.
I love you!

5
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:02,048
So many knees.
- Upcoming!

6
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:06,766
Okay, yes. Charlie,
I'll make you over breakfast.

7
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,605
I am ... awake.

8
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,030
Here we go.
- It begins.

9
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,538
I get pizza for breakfast?
- Yes.

10
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,836
Really?
- No.

11
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:38,664
Charlotte, come from that chair.
- No chance.

12
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,708
I count to three.
- No, Mom.

13
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,004
Here we go again.
- A ...

14
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:46,673
two, three ...
- Mom!

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,394
Used you count back?
- It works every time.

16
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,172
I am beginning to lunches.

17
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:06,230
A: Change.
That subtracting 42.

18
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:10,177
We can give back about $ 600.

19
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:13,833
You're kidding?
- Really?

20
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,548
Anyway.
- You turn it on!

21
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,173
I like you do!
- Good thing you're happy.

22
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:24,727
We go kiteboarding in Spain.
How sexy is that?

23
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:28,863
A Roth IRA begin
That's seksier.

24
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:33,857
We can not but 20 times
on the beach doing.

25
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:37,658
I think that is better.
Would you do it, no?

26
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,774
A fruitful idea.

27
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:43,766
As you can see there
the floor in oak.

28
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:48,245
Typical was this house
at 1.8 million ...

29
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:52,051
but now only 320,000.

1930
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:55,109
It drops down even.
- I think.

31
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,048
Wait is indeed better.

32
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:03,735
Hello, my people.
I like the Fosters.

33
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:10,316
Play Lego with me.
- First a small coma ...

34
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,363
and then we keep it
best Lego battle ever.

35
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:16,033
How you doing, Fosters?
- Hi, Katy.

36
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:20,298
All right next door?
- A babysitter is needed, right?

37
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:26,391
Is not it date night?
- Yeah, right, thanks for coming.

1938
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,988
We go on date night.
- You're too tired, baby.

39
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,374
No, I looked quite
the week off.

40
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,802
Unless you're too tired?
- No, it'll be fun.

41
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:39,246
We're going good, right?
We go.

42
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:49,119
Taste the puree with salmon you?
- Yes, very. Thanks.

43
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:54,590
On Sunday, Ollie
his friend Hayden a party.

44
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:57,626
Do I 'm sure a gift?
- Yes, but nothing about China ...

45
00:03:57,627 --> 00:04:00,377
nothing with batteries ...
I take it differently now.

46
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:10,381
What story is behind it?

47
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,389
Third date. The first
well, the second a disaster ...

48
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,547
She gives him a chance,
to show that he is not boring.

49
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,175
And he fails.

50
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,286
'I have a potato on my fork.

51
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:28,295
I like to eat potatoes ...

52
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,198
they are delicious ...

53
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,906
but I never stop
actually in my mouth. "

54
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,331
Not for me, Jeremy,
but I'm going home now ...

55
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:43,055
for winds to pick up a shoe box.

56
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,823
That is nonsense.

57
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:51,920
Look at love.

58
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:58,763
First appointment.
- No, he's got a ring.

59
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:04,467
No, married?
They are on the same side.

60
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:09,393
Bragging is.
- How to talk to each other.

61
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:13,671
Twisting your neck.
"Hi, how you doing? Good. "

62
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:16,810
Wedding Rings, definitely.

1963
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,776
This is a kid friendly place.

64
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,780
Coffee or dessert for you tonight?

65
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:26,584
What do you think?

66
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:30,060
I am so tired when I got my
head on the table would put ...

67
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:32,699
For 'n years would sleep.
No, only the account.

68
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:46,533
Where earlier today
DA Frank Crenshaw an ...

69
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,406
Hey, I wait in the sport.
- I promised the city ...

70
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:51,636
for its clean streets.

71
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:56,377
Let me tell you something.
This broom and I ...

72
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:59,446
not break our promises.
- I 'm going to sleep.

73
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,724
I'm so there.
- Book Club tomorrow.

74
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:04,122
We break them!

75
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,386
What 'oh'?

76
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:14,137
You put your foot bracket,
which means that we do not ...

77
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:17,477
You know.
- No, we can still mad.

78
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,159
Only if you feel like it.
- With all my heart, yes.

79
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,067
I will bring him here ...

80
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:28,426
I do not mind
if we do not.

81
00:06:28,427 --> 00:06:30,898
No, I ... Very happy.

82
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,503
I need me here on set.

83
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:37,685
No, it does not matter.
- You sure?

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,324
For by those potatoes
I am what windy.

85
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,710
We turn one on.
- You sure?

86
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,241
I will brighten your life.
Next time.

87
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,673
We make a quick tunes.
- What?

88
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,861
A fast tunes.
A quickie.

89
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:03,396
I can quickly ...
- Yes, it is good.

90
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:10,421
Nasran her feet and breasts
members when they went through the desert.

91
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:12,690
Blood dripped down her leg
the ground ...

92
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:17,440
leaving a large red stain
emptiness of living.

93
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,943
This part really appealed to me.
Walking 20 miles for water ...

94
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,548
and then discover that you
menstruating.

95
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:29,149
I could not stop crying.
- Ibid. Literally.

96
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,035
Best pathetic.
- Best sad?

97
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:38,179
You do not have any clue
what it is to show a teenage girl to ...

98
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,505
her first period
and that the rule of the Taliban.

99
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:44,770
That is correct.

100
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,174
And neither will you.

101
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:52,429
But ...
- Can you help me?

102
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,813
Yeah, thanks. Excuse me.

103
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:58,309
My God.

104
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,891
Do you have your period now?
- Yes.

105
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:05,147
This should really read.
A girl with her period in the wilderness.

106
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,566
Why do you do that still.

107
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:11,341
That is married.
Things you do not want.

108
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,544
I do not.
- How so?

109
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:17,279
Haley and I are apart.

110
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,996
But you are happy.
- No, not really.

111
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:23,693
Why do we
the book club here in your house?

112
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:25,014
I can not tell the kids.

113
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:28,153
Keep it to yourself until
I make it public.

114
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,587
Tell Claire.
- Yes, yes.

115
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:34,579
And how come?
- I thought everything was fine ...

116
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,862
Really. But we are stuck
in a role.

117
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:42,900
As Asian in Sixteen Candles,
Long Dog Dick.

118
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:45,613
Long Duk Dong.
- That guy.

119
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:48,611
Gedde Watanabe.
- He who can not play ...

120
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,473
How hard he tries.
He can not play doctor.

121
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:55,868
No, Long Duk Dong would
disguised as a doctor.

122
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,440
Exactly! And that's us.

123
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:03,794
We are not a couple anymore,
just ...

124
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,735
good roommates.

125
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:09,724
Better than excellent.
- Haley is down injured.

126
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:13,913
And I bet they
mind will change.

127
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,970
My best decision ever.

128
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,894
I've never been happier.

129
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:21,066
I can do what I want.
Dance.

130
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,863
If you have
The last dance?

131
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:27,934
No idea, our marriage?
- I want to dance every night.

132
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:32,264
And I want my top take off
and make do with three guys.

133
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,242
Three at once?
A nightmare.

134
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,636
This is literally a repeated
stress that I have.

135
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,894
What do you want?
- We know each other too well.

136
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:43,086
Always the same conversation,
same schedule ...

137
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,683
sex twice a week
in the same position.

138
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,949
Twice a week?
- Yes, so rare.

139
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:53,231
Yes, rare. Therefore
I was so surprised.

140
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:57,023
You seem much Naserin.

141
00:09:57,024 --> 00:10:00,096
This is not true.
- Yes it is.

142
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,582
Why is it all about me?
You are the one going crazy ...

143
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:06,846
You're like Naserin because you feel ashamed
how exciting you are.

144
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:09,152
You deserve to feel sexy.

145
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:13,626
And you have a bird rounds.
- The metaphor I do not understand.

146
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:17,531
It is not ...
- I'm still alive ...

147
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:20,307
We have a date tomorrow.
- Good.

148
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,707
Enjoy the puree and salmon.

149
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:26,635
A bird rounds.

150
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:34,455
Get that bird away.

151
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:22,666
Hi, baby.

152
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,593
Hi, guys.

153
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:29,302
What did you learn today?
- Nothing.

154
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:31,638
Fantastic.
Waiting for the high school.

155
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,045
Who'll win?
- Want something else wear?

156
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:35,132
No, I think ...

157
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:38,962
I ... You look beautiful.

158
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:41,639
I did this only briefly,
it's stupid ...

159
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,831
No, you look fantastic.
I ...

160
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:48,019
I'm going to change clothes and show a shower.

161
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,758
We would not miss the movie.
- Or a movie?

162
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,143
What do you think of a
dinner in the city?

163
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:57,039
We should not.
- Yes.

164
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,157
Forward. In 10 minutes ready.
I show you ...

165
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:03,302
to the new Sea-Food
take place ...

166
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:05,357
Claw? Do you get outside.

167
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,605
And the city is so far away.
- No.

168
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:10,744
You tell your potential customers are not
it's only 20 minutes far?

169
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:14,151
Yes, I lie. It's an hour.
- If we go on ...

170
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:17,121
ten minutes we are there for
seven and we show a table.

171
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:20,998
Yes? Say yes. Yes.
- Yes.

172
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,961
I do it.

173
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,872
How you doing?
- Names, please.

174
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:48,064
We have no reservation.
- We did not connect.

175
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:52,999
We crowded.
- We thought early to ...

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,103
and then a table.

177
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:59,388
Not met, huh.
- No.

178
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:03,789
Are there free tables?
- Yes ...

179
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,290
There are people who months
Book in advance ...

180
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:11,394
and it is 6:30 p.m. Friday
on the beautiful Island of Manhattan ...

181
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:13,564
So ... No.

182
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:18,455
We are on a date and
We wanted a special evening ...

183
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,919
So we ask you or your
have a free table?

184
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,114
Wait at the bar
and if a table is released ...

185
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:29,428
I come get you.
- Thanks.

186
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:32,561
Bye bye.
- We're there.

187
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,396
I had you already forgotten.

188
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,055
With Claw, welcome.

189
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:41,768
We are not the only one without a table.
I think we are lucky to have.

190
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,500
Good night.
- No idea what you are talking about.

191
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,862
Thanks. Very nice.
- Drink?

192
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:52,147
Yes, something with a great garnish,
because I am so hungry.

193
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,229
Hello.

194
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,812
Two Chardonnay, please.

195
00:13:57,407 --> 00:14:00,629
He's just distracted.
- Are we going elsewhere?

196
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,083
No, give it some time.
- Tripplehorn ...

197
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:05,072
table 2.

198
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,647
I want the night otherwise.

199
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:12,197
So do I. But it is so difficult.

200
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:14,981
Table 2.
- Return.

201
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:18,891
No, we're fine.
- This place is not 'us'.

202
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,542
Table 2. Tripplehorn?

203
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:25,089
What do you think of Tina Tavern,
a cozy table for two.

204
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,998
It's okay, really.
- No, it's not.

205
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:33,820
Tripplehorn, table 2!

206
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,616
We!

207
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:42,636
We are Tripplehorn.
- Great.

208
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:44,678
This way.

209
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:49,789
What are you doing, Phil?
- Trust me.

210
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,496
This should not.
- And here we are.

211
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:58,002
Can I take your coats?
- Yeah, thanks.

212
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:01,058
Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

213
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:03,540
Look at this table.
- Honey ...

214
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,700
No, honey. The Tripplehorn's
did not come.

215
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:09,276
Who are we angry?
Let us relax ...

216
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:12,171
and enjoy their seafood.

217
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:15,921
Or I suck on a napkin.
Holy ... Check prices.

218
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:19,601
If we pay so much for crab,
best he can sing, dance ...

219
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,855
and our proposals
The Little Mermaid.

220
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:27,066
So one great evening.

221
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:31,141
Brings no accident as
cheers to you 'n empty glass?

222
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:33,395
I think not.

223
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,743
I would change our children
for such a life like this.

224
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:44,054
You're so mean.
- It would be cool.

225
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:56,954
What's the story?

226
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,617
He's a successful manager ...

227
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:04,170
and she gets drunk enough
for all that later, to endure.

228
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:06,166
Because he likes weird things.

229
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,044
He goes with her hair
maiden address.

230
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,577
There, what's the story?

231
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:22,365
He is a record producer, and they
he wants to sign a contract.

232
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,564
No, that's Will.I.Am.
- Okay, he ...

233
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:31,961
and it's a backup singer ...
- No, he really Will.I.Am.

234
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:35,677
From Fergie.
- My God!

235
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:40,292
If I knew anything about him,
I was so excited.

236
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:43,169
Give me your phone.
- Why?

237
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,432
I take a picture.
- What?

238
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:48,594
Give him. You go to there.
- No.

239
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,762
And you're going to appoint yourself.

240
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:54,126
You are you so ashamed.

241
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:04,568
Got the picture?

242
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,108
You're a real freak.
That you really did.

243
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,272
Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Tripplehorn ...

244
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:22,646
Yes?
- Well, yes.

245
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,059
We are Tripplehorn.

246
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,225
Who are you, who
Questions about us?

247
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:32,643
We just wanted to here
talk to you.

248
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:36,596
And what is this about?
- You know.

249
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,842
Let everyone save the embarrassment,
and continue this conversation private.

250
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:43,816
But I can the rest of my
risotto with me?

251
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:47,062
For these truffles are
amazing and very expensive.

252
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,704
Go away. Now.

253
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:53,901
Honey, get out.

254
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:55,863
Now.

255
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:05,607
Can you just ...

256
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:09,211
A very expensive bottle.
I grab your glasses.

257
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:13,204
We move voluntarily.

258
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:17,153
Watch out.

259
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:21,516
Come on, we still
anybody hurt?

260
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,499
If I were you, I
say no more, bitch.

261
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:29,325
That's not nice.
- A bit dim, guys.

262
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,923
What are you doing?
That's my wallet.

263
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:35,949
And my phone ...
- I am now very pissed off.

264
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:41,447
Now I eat it off the ground.

265
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:46,103
I want to talk your boss now.
- That will not happen, Mr. Tripplehorn.

266
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:48,420
Or should I ...

267
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,392
Phil Foster say?

268
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:52,223
Use the drop when
make a reservation ...

269
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:54,781
do not use the same
aliases as your ransom letters stand.

270
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,817
Letters ransom?
- Did you really get away ...

271
00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:00,434
Joe Miletto could steal?

272
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:03,486
Someone somewhere is making a big mistake.

273
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,369
Guys, this ...
- If an error.

274
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,568
It's a very big misunderstanding.
We are Phil and Claire Foster ...

275
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:13,184
we know nothing about ransom letters.
I assure you.

276
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,318
You sat at the table.
The girl in front said ...

277
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,541
that you were the Tripplehorn.
- No, no ...

278
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:20,967
Let me explain.
My husband thought, very sweet, but ...

279
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:24,397
delusion that we are suggesting
asked one table would have ...

280
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:27,431
but we were too late.
They were very rude.

281
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,129
Thus rude.
- They called to Tripplehorn ...

282
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,869
and we said "we!".
We took him.

283
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,695
So you just took the
reservation for someone else?

284
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:40,090
I was also part.
My husband has some ideas in his head ...

285
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,666
a sort of thing.
- I'm an idiot sometimes.

286
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,996
Shut up.

287
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:48,532
I think you're the Fosters.
- Thanks.

288
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,029
I also believe that you
aka Tripplehorn is ...

289
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,862
and that you are my boss his
stable property ...

290
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:55,245
and that you're too worried
to admit it.

291
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:58,208
I give you three seconds
to the Flash Drive to!

292
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:01,871
The three-seconds game?
That I play every day.

293
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,568
This is another version!
- A ...

294
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,154
That's a big mistake ...
- Two ...

295
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:13,327
God, he turned it.
A deadly shot!

296
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,073
Help!
- Three!

297
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:19,044
No, no. All right,
I have the Flash Drive!

298
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:21,570
What?
- That's what I thought

299
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,607
Where is it?

300
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:27,629
In the park.
- The park?

301
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,362
Be more specific.

302
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,027
Central Park.

303
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,478
This will happen:

304
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:40,649
we go together to
that Central Park ...

305
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,428
and you show us exactly
where it is.

306
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:49,539
Okay.
- Come on!

307
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:19,372
Why do you take us to
the most desolate spot in New York?

308
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:22,134
The weapon was turned!
- We need to people.

309
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,275
Maybe people here,
as gay or nachtboters.

310
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,664
Night Boat?
- Yes, very popular.

311
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,428
It is good.

312
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:35,747
We must go to the boathouse.
- Trips.

313
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,568
There's nobody here.

314
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:58,663
That night boat stuff
was in Seattle, I think.

315
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:02,607
Maybe I can here them
what disconcert.

316
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:04,844
Open the door.

317
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,781
We may have to break in,
for I have no key.

318
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:15,927
Stay here.

319
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:23,090
We need people now.

320
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,488
Tell them that you have a medical condition.

321
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,959
We drugs out of the car
need ...

322
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,704
that just by "a doctor
can be given.

323
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:30,593
Why?
- It's for your penis.

324
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:32,696
Intravenous drug penis,
and you're very shy.

325
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:35,752
We need to show a hospital.
- What is wrong with my penis?

326
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,980
Forward.

327
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,479
Forward.

328
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:55,495
Where is it?
- The problem:

329
00:22:55,496 --> 00:23:00,082
Phil has a medical condition ...
- Give them just the flash drive.

330
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:07,024
Claire, just give them.
- We need to show a hospital.

331
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:09,552
But your penis.

332
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:13,549
It is a two-step procedure
that show a nurse has to happen.

333
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,656
Because there is a two-step ...
- My penis is fine!

334
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:22,265
Much can penis blood.
- Show him where it is!

335
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,851
Come on!
- Do 's good girl.

336
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:28,776
And listening to your spouse.
- Yeah, listen to me.

337
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:36,474
I put the flash drive over in the corner.

338
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:39,689
Where? Show it.

339
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,910
Come on, it's not a game.

340
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,633
I'm going to lift a floorboard.

341
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:54,159
There.

342
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:59,792
This one.

343
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,602
It is here.
- Where? I do not see it.

344
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,934
Run!

345
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,145
Come on.

346
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:24,945
Here.

347
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:34,738
Come on!

348
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,770
Full throttle.
- This is full throttle.

349
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,487
Come on.

350
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:09,240
Pick it up. Run.

351
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,338
We are going to die!

352
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,349
I do not want kids
go live with your mother!

353
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,232
She's horrible!
- Can you see?

354
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:19,112
No!

355
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:44,268
How did this happen?
- They are not what they seem.

356
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:48,578
You guys are coming!

357
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,691
Is it?

358
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:10,386
Phil, come on.

359
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:14,910
We need more walk.

360
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:17,394
I'm not in bad condition.
I'm afraid.

361
00:26:17,395 --> 00:26:19,706
So do I.

362
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:21,836
Ready?

363
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:27,529
Bring it on.

364
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,280
All of them.

365
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:32,824
My God, your blood?
- This is the Cabernet.

366
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,159
Sorry, you chewing gum?

367
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,097
Sorry, forgive me, I am
been working nine hours.

368
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:52,509
Once. Which restaurant?
- Claw.

369
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,408
That place in Tribeca,
with soup for $ 50?

370
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:58,423
How was that?
- Not great.

371
00:26:58,424 --> 00:27:01,904
We finally have someone
reservations taken.

372
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,583
You took one reservation?
- Yes.

373
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:08,117
We did.
- You just took a table.

374
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:11,005
Just so?
- Shocking, huh.

375
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:14,795
During our meal come
these guys show up ...

376
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:17,270
and they said they
Joe Miletto worked.

377
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,532
That they said.
When we knew that.

378
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:22,905
We thought the waiters there.
So we followed them out ...

379
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:26,978
and suddenly they grab our stuff.
Therefore we have no ID.

380
00:27:27,556 --> 00:27:29,717
Yes, that was very frightening.

381
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:33,674
Then came their arms above
and they asked for a flash drive.

382
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:38,288
Why grab my knee?
- Because we show appointments.

383
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:42,306
A gay couple,
met during the night boats.

384
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:48,812
God! The Bald and The Crazy.

385
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:55,115
Gay couple fucking.
We forgot our gay dinner.

386
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:58,114
Can I say something?

387
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:00,854
Joe Miletto dear husband is not ...

388
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:04,181
So if you're on his radar,
we need to talk to someone ...

389
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,986
No, you do not understand.
We took one reservation ...

390
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:10,183
So we must undo.
- Stop!

391
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:13,151
Put you down!

392
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:16,825
Arroyo?
- Yes?

393
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,430
Got a minute?

394
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,481
I'll be back. Make sure you
story is finished.

395
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:26,573
Forward.

396
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,476
Now they are dressed like cops.

397
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:33,166
Maybe they are agents.

398
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:37,593
Why are agents in
involved? What's happening?

399
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:41,166
What do we do?
- Honey.

400
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,282
They are going to kill us.
Dump our bodies in bags.

401
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:47,983
Breathe. Breathe?
- Only in.

402
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:50,447
Focus.

403
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:59,545
Your eyes look weird.
- I turn on. What should we do?

404
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:03,450
What should we do?
- We have to leave and go home.

405
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:06,449
We can not go home.
- I'm going home.

406
00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:12,908
I'm going home.
- They have our ID. They know where we live.

407
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:15,861
My God, the children.

408
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,476
Will you accept a collect call from ...

409
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:31,518
My God, it smells like urine.
- Yes, I accept that.

410
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,108
Everything is good with children?
- Yes.

411
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:38,590
I want you to continue a bit later tonight.

412
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:41,137
That is a problem for me.
- What?

413
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:44,687
I have to go to a party.
- You talk to her.

414
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:49,986
Katie with Phil. I do not have time
to talk, I'll pay you double.

415
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:52,017
I do not think enough.
- Are you kidding?

416
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:56,479
I miss the party, but I think
that what is expensive.

417
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,193
I see them.
- An hour? All right.

418
00:30:00,194 --> 00:30:05,104
Get the kids out of the house now.
Go out the back door, to your home.

419
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,890
Now it sounds a little dangerous.
- No.

420
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:11,735
That a further five charges extra.
- Fine, get the children out now.

421
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:15,181
We love them, and everything will be fine.
- All is well, tell him we love them.

422
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:18,742
Dick. Children.
- What now?

423
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:21,805
They are safe. We need a place
find a lot of people.

424
00:30:29,616 --> 00:30:32,385
This whole evening was a mistake.
We are humans.

425
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:35,506
We're just a boring couple from New Jersey,
this was an idiotic idea.

426
00:30:35,507 --> 00:30:37,830
It was not an idiot idea.
It was a dinner in Manhattan ...

427
00:30:37,831 --> 00:30:40,220
a night where we do not all night
the children need to talk ...

428
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:43,183
and what we do next week.
- Look where it brought us.

429
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:46,722
Should we call 112?
- We are talking about Joe Miletto.

430
00:30:46,723 --> 00:30:48,892
And?
- Those agents who wanted to murder us ...

431
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:51,501
who has in his pocket.
That guy owns agents.

432
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:53,909
We can not trust agent.
- What should we do?

433
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:55,829
We can not go home, not
to the police.

434
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,059
Miletto, why does he Tripplehorn?

435
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,814
Because they have the Flash Drive.

436
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:06,021
If they return the flash drive now?
- Why would they do that?

437
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:08,713
Because we will find
and we make sure they do.

438
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:10,716
If they have the Flash Drive
this is over.

439
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:13,831
Fine, I stand behind you.
I need you only one question.

440
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:18,738
Condemn me. What is a Flash Drive?
- Seriously?

441
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:23,216
Phil, I can not.
- That you put on the side of a laptop.

442
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:27,791
This is such a computer memory stick thing?
So we call in my office.

443
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:30,589
We must stick thing that computer have
to save our lives.

444
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:35,100
How? We know nothing about Tripplehorn.
- That's not quite true.

445
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,994
We know where to eat tonight.

446
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:40,867
Come on.

447
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:51,343
Hi, above. We have just
dinner with our friend 'Sam.I.Am.

448
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,848
You mean Will.I.Am?

449
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,573
If you call them so that's weird.
That's not nice.

450
00:31:55,574 --> 00:32:00,002
We were here, and Will.I.Am thinks he
phone on the table were lying, so ...

451
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,625
We must look on the table.
- I must look at the phone on the table.

452
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:04,571
If you do not mind.
- You understand what I say? Look at me.

453
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:07,648
We must look for the phone on the table.

454
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:12,292
Can you look at the phone on the table?
- Fine.

455
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:14,900
This way.
- I just wasted half my life.

456
00:32:20,086 --> 00:32:23,372
Look at the monitor.

457
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:32,444
He left it there on the table,
that was really a waste of time.

458
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,763
The King of Siam is hellish.

459
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:39,333
Thanks for your help,
I'm sarcastic.

460
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:43,536
Mother.

461
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:47,889
Claw, you're welcome.

462
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,276
We have a telephone. How to use
we get behind a address to come?

463
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:55,777
I think I know someone
who can help us.

464
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,466
What do you know this man again for?

465
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:00,252
I saw him a few houses to show
in the north.

466
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:04,182
It is a few years ago, but I remember
he was a security expert.

467
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:07,829
He eventually bought a house here
of an agent in this office.

468
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,299
I forgot the address, but perhaps
we can look into a file.

469
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,750
Got a key?
- No. May I have your coat?

470
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:15,934
Yes, you cold?
I think I can break open the lock.

471
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:20,877
If I had a hairpin can
I might get the lock open.

472
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:28,188
My God, who are you?
- Here, come on.

473
00:33:29,432 --> 00:33:33,327
No, we should look.
- It takes only a little.

474
00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:38,036
He called Holbrooke, Grant, do you see
in file cabinets. I look into your computer.

475
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:51,136
Come on.

476
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:54,313
Come on, rainbow wheel.

477
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:57,253
Come on.
- That's a bad sound.

478
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:02,506
I got it.
- Come on, get out.

479
00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:10,237
Come on.

480
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:31,817
Investigators.

481
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:34,889
Will you come and sit with me?

482
00:34:36,497 --> 00:34:39,356
Why are you a nice couple
from the suburbs to the balls?

483
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,343
Is not that a bit lower
your price range?

484
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:47,383
This conversation would be even better
If I knew what you were talking about.

485
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,147
Phil and Claire Foster.

486
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:52,162
Some of your men have them
arrested tonight at Claw.

487
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:54,818
They have a lot to scare them.
You know what I'm talking about.

488
00:34:55,785 --> 00:35:00,042
It tells me nothing. So unless
You want my company for tonight ...

489
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:02,683
not come back before
have an arrest warrant.

490
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,869
Slick, we have a problem?

491
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:23,058
This is it.

492
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,158
This is the place.

493
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:36,614
You may not know me anymore.
I'm Claire Foster ...

494
00:35:36,615 --> 00:35:39,746
I am a real estate agent.
I told you what homes in the north show.

495
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,101
Yes, I remember. It is already quite late.
- I know, and I'm sorry.

496
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:50,086
This is an emergency. Can I come over here?
It is very important.

497
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,938
Come upstairs.

498
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:59,930
I can not believe you feel, from hundreds
customers, remember this guy.

499
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:01,810
I've always been good
with names and faces.

500
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,960
Your memory is fantastic, honey.

501
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,903
That you feel all the people you see
This reminds ...

502
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,548
a ...

503
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:21,049
I get flashbacks of all
all these empty houses we saw.

504
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:24,201
We have many views.

505
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,239
That's me.

506
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:34,471
This is my husband, Phil Foster.
- How are you?

507
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:39,833
We have some problems, and
We really need help.

508
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:43,054
I know it's late, but if
Briefly, we can come ...

509
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:47,244
it's a great story, and you
We can help you.

510
00:36:47,245 --> 00:36:50,614
Please, I am your
falling far short.

511
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:54,818
Why not.
Come inside.

512
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:01,040
Sit down.

513
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:06,923
You're lucky to be alive.
I would stay away from those agents.

514
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,079
Therefore, we hoped you could help us.
- That's the least I can do.

515
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,870
You were so patient with me.
All those long trips on the toll road.

516
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:16,907
You're welcome.
This is definitely the right place for you.

517
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:20,631
The ladies love there from.
- It's okay with me.

518
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,663
I think you all do well.

519
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,811
I tell you what we must do.
We do not have much time ...

520
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:34,289
Do you have something on, then take
we are what we need, and ...

521
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,023
then we'll fall no more difficult.
- We have a phone ...

522
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:42,048
where we have an address, and you
yet had your own detective agency?

523
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:46,915
I practice personal protection, industrial
intelligence, government affairs, black ops ...

524
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,274
things like that.

525
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:53,395
There's your shirt. No wonder you
could not be found. It has to.

526
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,420
This is Natanya.

527
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:57,497
She is from Israel.
They do not speak much English.

528
00:37:58,273 --> 00:38:03,450
Are you also have sex with us?
- No, thanks.

529
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:06,465
Thank you, no.

530
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,314
Goodbye.
- I met her in Tel Aviv ...

531
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:35,114
when I was working with the Mossad,
she is a sweet girl.

532
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:38,602
She seems really sweet. It was very nice
her to ask if we wanted sex.

533
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:42,443
So ...
- Give me that number only.

534
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:48,537
We have the last of
Mr. and Mrs. Foster have not seen.

535
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:51,335
Someone has an alarm
in a real estate ...

536
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:53,676
security cameras have
these included.

537
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,661
The file from the computer will see an address
Holbrooke Grant, West Village.

538
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:02,566
What are they doing?
- What do we have?

539
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:05,300
Small burglary.

540
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:10,523
I tried to be friendly.
- Thank you, officer friendly.

541
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:15,484
Enough for today?
- Yes, sir. See you tomorrow.

542
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:19,233
Good evening.

543
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:24,444
Will we see?
- Yes, certainly. To the broker.

544
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,834
See where they are more
to have looked.

545
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,935
Where did all this stuff come from?
- Radio Shack.

546
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:37,940
Really?

547
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:41,477
What happened to him on?

548
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:47,336
Let me see that number.
Soft hands.

549
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:54,056
Here I type the number,
Thomas Felton is an alias I think.

550
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:56,779
Whether he is a big fan of the Tripplehorn.

551
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,932
There is no address.

552
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:03,413
It's a cell phone.
We do not need address book.

553
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:08,978
This number locates the signal ...
- That's great, you're ...

554
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:11,839
okay instruments.

555
00:40:22,906 --> 00:40:26,872
Mr. Felton's phone is located
at 135 Avenue D.

556
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:30,260
Great. Who likes shirts?

557
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:35,693
Thank you.
- It was the least I could do.

558
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:42,227
Are you expecting someone?
- This is the NYPD. We have some questions for you

559
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:44,575
These are the agents that we
attempted to murder.

560
00:40:47,898 --> 00:40:53,152
So come down. I'm having sex,
I'm working.

561
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:56,374
Am I, or is that 'Fat Albert'?
What was that?

562
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,129
Is there another exit?

563
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,575
Down to my garage.
There is a service elevator next to my office ...

564
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:04,210
I keep them busy.
Go ahead.

565
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:12,771
Can we get out?
- I think so.

566
00:41:13,794 --> 00:41:17,698
They are still there. Here we come
not pass. Think.

567
00:41:19,405 --> 00:41:21,492
What are you doing?

568
00:41:21,493 --> 00:41:24,154
You can not do.
This is Holbrooke's car.

569
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:26,882
Let's get outta here.
Do you have a better idea?

570
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:38,379
That's not really driving in the city.

571
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,337
This is a sports car.

572
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:45,525
Thank God that Holbrooke was there.
- Yes.

573
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:47,947
Thank God.

574
00:41:47,948 --> 00:41:51,066
Holbrooke hell out really late.
- Sorry?

575
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:54,977
What was that? Who were you there?
Who is this person?

576
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:58,549
That giggling flirting charming person?
- What are you talking about?

577
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,245
When you look on him,
explained to you.

578
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:04,759
If a spark sparking.
- That's not true.

579
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,249
True. And I understand.
Because I also explained.

580
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,398
He is super seksie. And why
muscles on your shoulders you need?

581
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:15,477
That way.
And I'm the man but.

582
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:19,149
I'm just an idiot who does not know
how to load the dishwasher.

583
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,091
I'm the guy who needs more training.

584
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:27,076
Who should light the man?
- I had forgotten to explain to you.

585
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,497
This is ...
- Why do I always forget?

586
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:32,837
I remember.
I am every day ...

587
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:35,881
make breakfast, go to work,
come home, clean the house clean ...

588
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:38,925
remove the children, bring and fetch them
football, cooking dinner ...

589
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:42,183
over dinner, tuck them in the bath,
pull their panties to ...

590
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,119
that's a battle every night, the
is always a big surprise ...

591
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,599
every night they have a pajamas,
and after I everyone ...

592
00:42:50,729 --> 00:42:53,620
and eat snot to me washed I use
I have the energy I have left ...

593
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:57,896
for myself physically in our bed to lay in
rather to highlight for you.

594
00:42:57,897 --> 00:43:01,619
Let's stop.
This is a great time to ...

595
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,117
Yes, we should stop.
I know you work hard.

596
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:06,616
But you know what all that hard work
would make ten times easier?

597
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,727
I.

598
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:12,148
If you would trust me occasionally to
things to address. But you do not.

599
00:43:12,149 --> 00:43:14,481
You should do yourself, your way.

600
00:43:14,482 --> 00:43:17,535
I do everything at this stage to error,
even before I even get a chance.

601
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:21,169
If you let me do something for you,
I think ...

602
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,436
I will leave you amazed.

603
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:26,645
I know I will leave you amazed.

604
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,799
You think I do not hear myself, I
enjoy it like a bitch to come?

605
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:40,863
Hailey and Brad want to divorce.
- I know.

606
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:43,133
Have you ever thought about
to leave with me?

607
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,102
No.

608
00:43:45,103 --> 00:43:48,076
You've never fantasized about me
leaving for another man?

609
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:53,453
No. I fantasize sometimes about
to be alone.

610
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:58,243
What do you mean?
- There are times ...

611
00:43:58,244 --> 00:44:01,432
I thought about it,
on my worst days ...

612
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:06,366
to leave.
And then to book a hotel ...

613
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:12,050
and alone in a quiet room to be
with air conditioning ...

614
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:16,160
sitting down to eat my lunch with anyone
that touches me ...

615
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:18,742
Light and then a Sprite to drink.

616
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:21,773
All alone.
- That sounds terrible.

617
00:44:21,774 --> 00:44:26,257
I just want a day that is not from
depends on how the days of all others expired.

618
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:29,593
I do not have dirty sex fantasy or something.

619
00:44:29,594 --> 00:44:32,106
That I would understand.

620
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:37,079
Everyone has dirty sex fantasies.
Those of you is clear with Holbrooke.

621
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,478
Mine with Cyndi Lauper.

622
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:43,935
Really? In the past or present.
- Any time of day.

623
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:47,946
What an interesting choice.

624
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:54,642
Brad told me that everything was fine
with him and Hailey.

625
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:59,734
And they really excellent
were roommates.

626
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,034
We have not, right?
- No.

627
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,764
Right?

628
00:45:16,986 --> 00:45:20,002
We have to move.

629
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,476
135 Avenue D. Here it is.

630
00:45:31,477 --> 00:45:33,974
I park here.

631
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,757
They are not home.

632
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:47,364
We wait.
- How long?

633
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:49,812
The agents who were Holbrooke
can now go on this way.

634
00:45:52,432 --> 00:45:55,483
The fourth floor.

635
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,663
What are you doing?
- If we Tripplehorn not find ...

636
00:45:57,664 --> 00:46:00,769
we might even find their Flash Drive.
Come here.

637
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:08,312
We can do it.
- Am I dressed up one night.

638
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:11,457
Ready?
One, two, three, go!

639
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:16,099
Give everything.

640
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:26,930
Everything you do, I do high heels.

641
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:29,674
I want you to think about it.

642
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,873
They have a chicken with
crushed with a highlighter.

643
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:59,326
These are bad people.
Look you there, I look here.

644
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,507
Damn, Phil.
- What?

645
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:16,737
Why do you never shut the drawers?
- I'm sorry.

646
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:20,967
You never close to a la
you've opened.

647
00:47:28,464 --> 00:47:30,672
Do not move.

648
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:34,373
Who is it?
- Now move.

649
00:47:36,618 --> 00:47:39,641
This is not as it looks.
- Look here for.

650
00:47:39,642 --> 00:47:42,381
He has broken my neck.
- Stop it.

651
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:47,135
We can explain everything.
- What are you doing here?

652
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:53,814
Sit down.
Hurry up you two.

653
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:57,128
Careful.

654
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,682
You must be Thomas Felton?

655
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:03,177
People call me 'Taste'.

656
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:06,802
I think the people you
Tripplehorn call.

657
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:11,919
I'm a big fan of Jane Tripplehorn.
- Yes, she's a great actress.

658
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:13,654
Who is this?
- I'm Whippet.

659
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:15,501
Whippet like a dog?

660
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:18,462
No, as you come from a nitric
cream sucks.

661
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:25,644
Stupid bitch.
- Have you ever contacted your mother?

662
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,006
This is a beautiful thing.
Are we going to duel with ten steps?

663
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,039
Zip your mouth shut.
- My head zip up?

664
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,540
Really?
- He said "zip your mouth shut."

665
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:38,011
Is that your best 'tough guy sense?

666
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:41,436
You heard me. Unzip your face shut.
- Zipper you vagina but close, Raymond Burke.

667
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:44,379
I do not know how I should respond.

668
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,112
'F' you.
- 'F' me, 'F' you.

669
00:48:47,113 --> 00:48:49,945
'F' you.
- 'F' you. What are you doing here?

670
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,668
'F' you, fucking fucker.

671
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,786
What do you want?
- You have no idea what you've done to us.

672
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:01,198
What?

673
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,399
When you were in your reservation Claw missed
You've ruined our lives.

674
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,737
What are you talking about?
- We have missed nothing.

675
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:12,826
We saw the two gangsters Case
check, so we have gone away.

676
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:16,682
Are you the reservation police?
- What will you tell?

677
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:19,552
We had not booked,
So we have taken from you.

678
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:21,662
And now they think that we you are.

679
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,359
You have made our reservations?
Who does that?

680
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,445
What people are you?

681
00:49:27,446 --> 00:49:31,786
Come on.
- How did you find our way?

682
00:49:31,787 --> 00:49:34,418
I need your number stolen
the reservation list.

683
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:37,688
That is smart.
- Thank you.

684
00:49:38,379 --> 00:49:41,725
Have you used our real number
make a reservation?

685
00:49:41,726 --> 00:49:46,154
Not home, but the cell phone.

686
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:52,082
That is brilliant.
You're really a criminal genius.

687
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:56,821
So I'm an asshole all the time?
I can not live up to things you think?

688
00:49:56,822 --> 00:49:58,854
Yes.
- I can not do anything right?

689
00:49:58,855 --> 00:50:02,560
I buy the wrong soft drinks,
the wrong beer ...

690
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:04,440
I hear you, man.
- The wrong nipple clamps.

691
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:06,894
These clips made me hurt.

692
00:50:06,895 --> 00:50:09,554
And when I come home, watch me
not even.

693
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,621
I have to beg for sex.
As if it is a gift.

694
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:14,962
And forget the back but.

695
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,574
Forget that.
- That has been forgotten.

696
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:23,099
I'm sorry if what I am tired,
after having worked all night.

697
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,570
And then come home, you jumping,
and give you a free lapdance.

698
00:50:26,571 --> 00:50:31,210
Sorry. I was very happy to strip
and make money at the Hippo.

699
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:33,927
It made me feel good.

700
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:38,997
I earned money.
But you should be greedy ...

701
00:50:38,998 --> 00:50:41,701
and began to steal everything from everyone.
- That's enough.

702
00:50:41,702 --> 00:50:46,621
Sorry I dream. I do not want the rest
of my life stolen car seats sold.

703
00:50:46,656 --> 00:50:48,532
I think you're losing control.

704
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:51,039
My dream then? And me?
- Stop arguing.

705
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,491
Stop arguing.
Everybody valve.

706
00:50:55,492 --> 00:50:57,530
Dampers close.
- Be quiet.

707
00:50:57,531 --> 00:51:01,166
These gangsters were behind us, because
they think we have a flash drive ...

708
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:02,871
that you have stolen from them.
You go to so far ...

709
00:51:02,872 --> 00:51:05,197
and tell them that you
The Tripplehorn are.

710
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:09,713
Wait a minute, bitch.
- Do not call me bitch, whore.

711
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:15,422
Are thugs who now follow you?
- Have you not heard what I said, whore?

712
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:18,650
Why we are here.
You need us anything.

713
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:20,644
We must now get outta here.

714
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:24,489
Whippet, honey, 2 minutes.
Ready? Hurry.

715
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:27,786
Hurry.
- You can not leave.

716
00:51:27,787 --> 00:51:29,908
Forget Latex.
Only the most important.

717
00:51:29,909 --> 00:51:32,170
Stop suits, no one
going somewhere.

718
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:37,696
Stop. You take up too much of.
- What are you doing?

719
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:39,533
Nothing you don
30 seconds lost.

720
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:42,357
Bobby De Niro, a classic.

721
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,219
Really. You are going nowhere.

722
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,775
Stop. Nobody goes somewhere.

723
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:50,549
Watch me.

724
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,574
This we do.

725
00:51:53,575 --> 00:51:57,329
We take the flash drive, and you bring ...
- Take him yourself.

726
00:51:58,111 --> 00:52:00,703
Honey, we're off.
- Yes.

727
00:52:01,733 --> 00:52:03,521
I'm done. Here.

728
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:06,388
Come on.
- Wait.

729
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,976
Maybe not a good idea to leave.
This is our home.

730
00:52:09,977 --> 00:52:13,276
No, it's not.

731
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:17,611
This is your house.

732
00:52:24,626 --> 00:52:27,796
Come home.

733
00:52:37,674 --> 00:52:39,878
How do we bring this to Miletto?

734
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:42,496
Joe Miletto. The boy who blackmails you.

735
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:45,957
You're far from home, or not?
- What do you mean to them?

736
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:48,450
Nice evening.

737
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:53,528
That's not gone
as I had expected.

738
00:52:56,086 --> 00:53:00,184
Come on. Did you see how her tongde?
- Yes.

739
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,611
Welcome, officers.

740
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:08,916
Are you Holbrooke Grant?
- Yes.

741
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:11,861
Want some clothes?
- No.

742
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:14,437
It's late and I have already told everything
against other agents.

743
00:53:14,438 --> 00:53:16,739
Wait. What other agents?

744
00:53:30,935 --> 00:53:33,695
What did that when he said Taste
we were far from home?

745
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:37,638
He is called "Taste".
I would not attract much.

746
00:53:42,016 --> 00:53:45,342
What is this?
- Gun.

747
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,535
This is a fucking gun.

748
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:03,883
Take care.
- Do not shout. I know what I do.

749
00:54:06,002 --> 00:54:09,892
It's one way.
- I'm sorry.

750
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:12,410
I am sorry Wait.

751
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:15,818
What are you doing?
- Wait.

752
00:54:23,508 --> 00:54:26,827
What are you doing?

753
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:28,525
We need you to pick us.

754
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:30,900
We need as quickly as possible, Phil.

755
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:43,157
That does not work.
- Put him in the back, asshole.

756
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:48,249
You put him in reverse.
Put it in reverse.

757
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,666
In reverse.

758
00:55:12,471 --> 00:55:14,455
There is someone pissed off.

759
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:17,966
It seems that they come with us.

760
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:37,117
Why I drive backwards?

761
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:42,500
Take your foot off the brake.
- No.

762
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,192
Come on.

763
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:59,235
Put your foot on the brake.
- No, I did not get off.

764
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:07,776
Take the wheel.
- What?

765
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:10,513
Just do.
He would not release the brake.

766
00:56:11,276 --> 00:56:13,529
No.

767
00:56:15,198 --> 00:56:17,744
You owe me one, eh?

768
00:56:19,306 --> 00:56:21,583
Take a side with your ass.

769
00:56:29,656 --> 00:56:32,206
Move on.

770
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:39,693
We get some.

771
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:44,854
Why do they want us
so like murder?

772
00:56:44,855 --> 00:56:48,452
Do you have a computer or a BlackBerry?

773
00:56:48,453 --> 00:56:50,795
I have a Candle.
- Give.

774
00:56:50,796 --> 00:56:54,174
It's a gift. Not break.
- Really?

775
00:56:54,175 --> 00:56:56,441
I had to cry.

776
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:01,820
And the morning we walk
the birds of change

777
00:57:04,322 --> 00:57:06,523
This is Crenshaw.
The DA.

778
00:57:06,558 --> 00:57:09,143
Claire, we need the street.
- Why?

779
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:11,299
If I 'right' hey, go right.

780
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,377
I have a plan.
Now!

781
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,725
This is the NYPD.
The street is closed.

782
00:57:24,726 --> 00:57:26,782
Convert your car immediately stopped.

783
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,050
Great, Phil.
- I had to try something.

784
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:32,649
I thought I had a plan.
- I love you, but your plans do not work.

785
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,204
Ensure you that you "married people
stuff "to get a list ...

786
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:37,996
if my life is at stake.

787
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,353
When I press the horn,
You press on the brake ...

788
00:57:40,354 --> 00:57:43,207
your wife switches.
And you kicked him.

789
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:46,057
This will work.
- We got him!

790
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:49,485
Well, folks,
one, two, three ...

791
00:57:49,486 --> 00:57:51,255
Stop the vehicle.
- Now!

792
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,345
What did I tell you?

793
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:17,404
And now to put aside
then we can ...

794
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:26,934
The brake does not work.
- The brake does not work?

795
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:28,470
The brakes are gone.

796
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,905
Since you're pretty done with it.
I'm leaving.

797
00:58:30,906 --> 00:58:33,318
Fine, until later.

798
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,508
I Manker nothing.

799
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,583
Come on.

800
00:59:04,761 --> 00:59:07,048
Well done sweetie.
You're doing good.

801
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:16,933
Is everything okay?
- Cold.

802
00:59:22,954 --> 00:59:24,583
The Flash Drive is gone.

803
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:29,057
The Tripplehorn are gone.

804
00:59:30,284 --> 00:59:32,780
We have nothing.

805
00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:37,677
Let's see if
there is a blanket in the car.

806
00:59:41,674 --> 00:59:44,409
I am curious to hear
what happened here.

807
00:59:44,505 --> 00:59:48,250
While we sit drinking a beer,
there are two people inside the bar ...

808
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,251
The two people you've just let go.
The Fosters?

809
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:53,740
The Fosters.
You have a good memory.

810
00:59:54,077 --> 00:59:58,054
But they come in and so on
we know they will shoot at us.

811
00:59:58,055 --> 01:00:01,948
Mr. Foster? Tax lawyer
was armed?

812
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,133
That is strange.
- That's weird.

813
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,944
It is also dangerous,
so we chased them.

814
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,506
You know what, well done.
Go home.

815
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,608
If you want we can continue
detect them.

816
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:16,384
Nice evening.

817
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:19,213
We have understood.
- Say your prayers but.

818
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:32,040
What was at
computer stick that thing?

819
01:00:32,169 --> 01:00:34,156
What great books and photographs.

820
01:00:34,252 --> 01:00:36,572
Pictures of what?
- Services rendered.

821
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:39,805
And one of Joe's Milletto clubs
Peppermint Hippo named.

822
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:43,883
But that does not get out now, that computer
Stick thing is at the bottom of river.

823
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,746
And we will finish
as agents find us.

824
01:00:46,747 --> 01:00:49,108
Explain to me one more time ...

825
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:51,233
Honey!
- If I get shot ...

826
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,830
I would like to know why that is.

827
01:00:54,582 --> 01:00:58,685
What are you laughing at?
- I think it's nice, but we are not really ...

828
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,190
shot.
- I think so.

829
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:02,443
I do not think so.

830
01:01:02,697 --> 01:01:09,181
The strange thing is that Ledger had only
but photographs and information from a customer.

831
01:01:09,216 --> 01:01:12,900
Crenshaw DA.
- That guy with the broom?

832
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:16,044
The Tripplehorn may have
Flash Drive Miletto stolen ...

833
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:17,985
but they pressed the DA off.

834
01:01:17,986 --> 01:01:21,508
Taste therefore reacted so strangely
Miletto about when you started.

835
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:25,883
I see.
Does it have anything to do with Crenshaw?

836
01:01:26,973 --> 01:01:28,963
But there is definitely something to do
Crenshaw with ...

837
01:01:28,964 --> 01:01:31,832
He is the key. And we must
find a way to come to Crenshaw.

838
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:34,819
The Tripplehorn have him
at the Peppermint Hippo found.

839
01:01:36,565 --> 01:01:38,758
And we are Tripplehorn's?

840
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,225
We are, yes.

841
01:01:44,385 --> 01:01:48,468
We could use some help.
- Waxing, of course.

842
01:01:55,053 --> 01:01:57,452
Is that my tracksuit?

843
01:01:57,703 --> 01:02:00,308
Yes, that was in the trunk of your Audi ...

844
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:02,626
and which is now parked at the
East River ...

845
01:02:02,627 --> 01:02:05,878
and he can now use a beurtje ...

846
01:02:05,879 --> 01:02:09,755
which I do in the next
decades programs will repay ...

847
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:15,052
centuries old gun like that
I've taken ...

848
01:02:15,053 --> 01:02:17,644
who is also proved useless.

849
01:02:17,645 --> 01:02:21,363
He just popped apart.
- But for that reason we are not here.

850
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:24,089
How unreal all this is
may sound ...

851
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:28,852
you after we have seen our
evening only become stranger ...

852
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:33,588
There were cars that were stuck together.
One of those cars was yours ...

853
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:36,651
I myself have a quite interesting
evening and I am very tired ...

854
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:40,492
how fun it is you again,
would rather go to somebody else's door.

855
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:46,212
I just wanted my wife to dinner ...

856
01:02:46,213 --> 01:02:54,404
I was hoping we could one evening
with the feeling of yesteryear ...

857
01:02:54,405 --> 01:02:57,264
but now I only go home.

858
01:02:58,054 --> 01:03:01,142
Now that I have a plan to
pull it off ...

859
01:03:01,143 --> 01:03:03,936
my plans are generally not
so good, but now I have one ...

860
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,489
and I need help.

861
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:09,232
Although I would commit suicide if I
muscle bundle to your look ...

862
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:13,058
and your girlfriend is so beautiful that it seems
like a glittering jet looks ...

863
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:17,228
yet I know and believe I
that a person in there is ...

864
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:20,590
who understands exactly
I now must make.

865
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:26,109
So please, Holbrooke,
can we come?

866
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,259
Give us the chance to explain your
what we want ...

867
01:03:31,268 --> 01:03:37,353
and want to fuck
a shirt?

868
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:46,064
Come on.

869
01:04:03,813 --> 01:04:06,682
Here it is, you know the plan yet?
- Hardly.

870
01:04:15,274 --> 01:04:19,110
Let us inside. It is new,
they must work tonight.

871
01:04:19,144 --> 01:04:21,345
I do not know what you're talking about.
- I'm the new girl.

872
01:04:21,346 --> 01:04:25,072
Really?
And who are you?

873
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:28,145
I'm her pimp.
- You're her pimp?

874
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:31,792
Yeah asshole, he is my pimp,
I can now work ...

875
01:04:31,793 --> 01:04:35,026
or should I call Joe Miletto
to say that his later, Piccolo?

876
01:04:41,562 --> 01:04:43,834
I have no gum.

877
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:48,044
The locker room is left.
- Come on, pimp.

878
01:04:59,616 --> 01:05:02,041
Wait here.
- Where are you going?

879
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:14,770
That must be a monkey.

880
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:28,348
Hey, I'm still down a man,
do you think?

881
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:30,519
Sorry I ...
my God!

882
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,351
I know,
never mind.

883
01:05:32,352 --> 01:05:34,189
You look really great.

884
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:37,191
Why is it so clear,
it should still be dark and dim ...

885
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:40,174
just love to take a 40 year
old stripper / mother.

886
01:05:41,398 --> 01:05:44,442
Do your breasts once.
- I had to attract opposite ...

887
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:47,078
and then run. By
I think I lost a nipple.

888
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:49,974
No, you look great.
- Really?

889
01:05:50,354 --> 01:05:52,295
Really.

890
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:54,559
This was the only long enough
was to cover my caesarean.

891
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,704
I keep looking at your breasts.

892
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,621
Let's go.
I want you to buy.

893
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:07,844
This is the end of days stuff.

894
01:06:29,354 --> 01:06:31,607
Honey, I think I can not.

895
01:06:31,608 --> 01:06:36,511
Of course you do this, you are
a beautiful strong woman ...

896
01:06:36,545 --> 01:06:40,198
you are the mother of my children.
I want you to go inside ...

897
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:43,139
and let the Gucci pop.

898
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:46,158
These Gucci pop it,
and then we can go home.

899
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:47,804
Come on you can do it.
- I can.

900
01:06:53,549 --> 01:06:55,468
If you just want to look up.

901
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:03,942
Fine, you can enter.

902
01:07:03,943 --> 01:07:06,220
No, you both.

903
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,456
He likes you too nice.

904
01:07:09,816 --> 01:07:14,455
Someone pointed out by the pervert.
- I can not.

905
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:18,517
Yes, because you are a beautiful
husband and the father of my children ...

906
01:07:18,518 --> 01:07:21,419
So you go in there
and revolves around that pole as a refugee.

907
01:07:30,945 --> 01:07:33,031
There he is with those sunglasses.

908
01:07:37,409 --> 01:07:41,012
What happened to him by the hand
that's dirty, that he do not need.

909
01:07:41,911 --> 01:07:44,288
Enough junk to clean.

910
01:07:47,468 --> 01:07:51,005
Can I help you?
- We are here for Crenshaw.

911
01:07:51,126 --> 01:07:53,802
You can only join him in the neighborhood
if he chooses you.

912
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:56,344
Choose, for what?

913
01:07:56,415 --> 01:07:58,901
Carlton, go again to step aside.

914
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:05,032
I think you avoid okay, honey.
A wild western, lounge-like.

915
01:08:05,486 --> 01:08:08,424
Without syphilis.

916
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:11,368
You have a big mouth,
I think that's fine.

917
01:08:12,036 --> 01:08:15,493
And have your friend androgenouse
included.

918
01:08:15,494 --> 01:08:18,236
Is he a man or a woman.
I do not know.

919
01:08:19,654 --> 01:08:21,205
I'll let you guess.

920
01:08:22,955 --> 01:08:24,669
It's very sexy.

921
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:27,590
Why do not you two see here
what you can.

922
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,852
I think he wants us to
him to dance.

923
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:32,066
If it does, we must better
do the fast version.

924
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:35,736
Go ahead, if you spend time with me
want, you deserve it.

925
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:40,913
So go there but are.
Women to one side please.

926
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,667
Actually we are not ...

927
01:08:44,668 --> 01:08:48,494
we do not like dancing,
We prefer to talk with you ...

928
01:08:48,495 --> 01:08:50,249
and then remain relatively quiet.

929
01:08:50,284 --> 01:08:52,557
We want to talk to you.
- I am not here to talk ...

930
01:08:52,558 --> 01:08:55,928
whether you leave or go dancing.
What is it?

931
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:33,597
I do not feel it.
Carlton, if you like ...

932
01:09:33,598 --> 01:09:35,385
their education as the door, please.

933
01:09:36,903 --> 01:09:40,836
We're just warming up,
Now we will feel the heat.

934
01:09:40,837 --> 01:09:43,516
We are now going to happen.

935
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:46,551
Now we go!
- Count on that!

936
01:09:47,024 --> 01:09:49,814
Now the hot and wild.

937
01:10:04,837 --> 01:10:07,088
Where he takes her to?

938
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:50,591
Phil are not going to surrender.

939
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:53,206
What will they do?

940
01:11:10,572 --> 01:11:12,671
Sex robots.

941
01:11:18,935 --> 01:11:20,825
Come here, you two.

942
01:11:24,299 --> 01:11:27,647
We have something you want.
- I know for sure.

943
01:11:27,785 --> 01:11:30,853
How much for a night?
- $ 100,000.

944
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:36,055
That's quite a bit. I know of no
Women who are worth so much.

945
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:38,670
How about a woman with
a Flash Drive?

946
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:43,008
How are you?
We are Tripplehorn.

947
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:48,508
They just keep coming with those weapons.

948
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:51,997
Why do not we take a walk
to talk about.

949
01:11:52,732 --> 01:11:54,869
Private.

950
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:57,826
This was so beautiful can be.

951
01:12:06,665 --> 01:12:08,500
This is part of the plan right?

952
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,362
I must go back into the underground
for a refresher.

953
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:16,301
Let's keep this simple ...

954
01:12:16,302 --> 01:12:20,422
you give me the Flash Drive or Collins
breaks both arms of your wife.

955
01:12:20,832 --> 01:12:23,979
I have the flash drive hidden where nobody
will find him ...

956
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:28,243
Holbrooke if Grant is not the hour
learn from us, until we are safe ...

957
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:30,908
He will drive the content of that
disclose.

958
01:12:33,498 --> 01:12:35,949
He is the ex-soldier
We have interviewed the last night ...

959
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,321
He is real.

960
01:12:38,343 --> 01:12:40,448
What's going on?

961
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:44,576
Sorry, we seek a roof thing '
account, it only takes a minute.

962
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:48,398
No, you get a minute.
This is my roof, baby.

963
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:51,776
It is good Claire, we
they expect.

964
01:12:51,777 --> 01:12:54,442
We are really lost.

965
01:12:54,443 --> 01:12:55,825
They were just about
Joe leave ...

966
01:12:55,826 --> 01:12:58,697
they have someone on hand with
The flash drive is nothing to get here.

967
01:12:58,698 --> 01:13:00,095
Have you seen the flash drive?

968
01:13:00,096 --> 01:13:04,043
Do not worry,
We will say nothing about those pictures.

969
01:13:04,044 --> 01:13:06,587
Shut up.
- What kind of photos?

970
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:08,107
Nothing.
- Does he not?

971
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:12,747
What I do not know?
- I think I said too much.

972
01:13:12,748 --> 01:13:16,908
Sorry, but I can understand why you
pornographic pictures of the DA have ...

973
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:18,350
you never know
when they come in handy.

974
01:13:18,351 --> 01:13:22,053
Close your mouth, Skippy.
- Connect your vagina but you.

975
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:26,476
No, if he says vagina,
he means your face.

976
01:13:26,477 --> 01:13:29,307
You have said that what those Flash Drive
stood with city contracts ...

977
01:13:29,308 --> 01:13:34,523
that way you wiped clean.
All this time I keep the police away from you ...

978
01:13:34,524 --> 01:13:38,465
while you dirty pictures of me kept?
- Very dirty pictures.

979
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:42,819
You could sit in jail if not for me
was. So watch your tone, Mr. DA.

980
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:46,177
You have something to talk
So my wife and I give you that room.

981
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:50,507
Nobody move there because it is a piece
easier if someone dies.

982
01:13:50,508 --> 01:13:53,140
As with "The Kill Shot".

983
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:55,914
Put the gun down!
- Come on, policeman.

984
01:13:55,915 --> 01:14:01,674
It's okay.
- This is not good this is a bad idea.

985
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,959
Now shoot me.
- It will go on shooting anyone.

986
01:14:05,055 --> 01:14:06,729
Claire, look at me ...

987
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:09,898
look at me!
I have this under control ...

988
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:13,527
I got this under control.

989
01:14:18,273 --> 01:14:20,101
Count to three.
- What?

990
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:24,615
Just count.
- No, that does not work with adults with weapons.

991
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:27,188
Trust me on this one.

992
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,555
I've had enough ...

993
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:38,176
my kids will have 90 minutes
awake, so it stops here ...

994
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:44,037
I count to three and then made everyone
weapons.

995
01:14:44,038 --> 01:14:45,587
Does she seriously?

996
01:14:45,683 --> 01:14:47,566
A.
- I think she thinks.

997
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:49,449
Two.
- They're kidding right?

998
01:14:51,284 --> 01:14:53,548
Three.

999
01:14:54,527 --> 01:14:58,039
This is the NYPD, let your arms fall
and hands in the air.

1000
01:15:03,409 --> 01:15:05,877
Let your arms fall
and hands in the air.

1001
01:15:06,393 --> 01:15:08,782
I'm a cop.
- No, not anymore.

1002
01:15:08,783 --> 01:15:11,639
I told you I could surprise you.

1003
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,691
Well you see again, Detective.

1004
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:19,456
You also Mr. Foster.
- This was part of the plan?

1005
01:15:19,457 --> 01:15:22,737
The helicopter and the SWAT team
are all part of your plan?

1006
01:15:22,738 --> 01:15:26,294
Your friend Holbrooke has called me to
here to be 5.30 ...

1007
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:28,496
you've got something for me?
- Yes, that's right.

1008
01:15:29,777 --> 01:15:35,784
I think that getting up enough
to those two a while to close.

1009
01:15:35,785 --> 01:15:37,637
Thank you.

1010
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:43,679
Mr. Miletto, Mr. DA ...

1011
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,353
you two are under arrest,
for obstruction of justice ...

1012
01:15:46,354 --> 01:15:50,056
extortion, conspiracy and I believe
including prostitution.

1013
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,787
Move them out.

1014
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:56,316
Do you need a ride?

1015
01:15:56,317 --> 01:15:59,235
Yes please, our children will
is it bad frightened.

1016
01:15:59,236 --> 01:16:03,246
No, we have sent somebody,
They are wonderful to sleep with the babysitter.

1017
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:05,346
Thank God.

1018
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:08,215
What is your story?

1019
01:16:11,711 --> 01:16:14,747
Just a boring married couple from
New Jersey.

1020
01:16:15,588 --> 01:16:17,193
So what about that elevator.

1021
01:16:17,194 --> 01:16:21,543
I actually had my wife
dinner in the city promised.

1022
01:16:32,684 --> 01:16:36,525
I'm not sure but I think this
the best pancake I've ever had.

1023
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:41,050
How did you come to that plan?

1024
01:16:42,273 --> 01:16:44,702
It's like that book
the book club ...

1025
01:16:44,703 --> 01:16:48,608
Nasrin ensures that her brother and
stepfather to squabble ...

1026
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:51,408
so they can be off to
pulling through the desert ...

1027
01:16:51,504 --> 01:16:53,112
and peace can menstruate.

1028
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,089
What?
- You read the book?

1029
01:16:58,122 --> 01:17:00,648
Of course. I have them all
read.

1030
01:17:00,672 --> 01:17:03,688
Why?
- Because you care about.

1031
01:17:06,008 --> 01:17:09,839
I only read the first 30
and the last page.

1032
01:17:10,438 --> 01:17:14,478
Who has time to read. I love
not even of those books.

1033
01:17:21,248 --> 01:17:24,282
What? I sit here a little?

1034
01:17:28,759 --> 01:17:30,560
I would do so again.

1035
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:33,587
Tonight, no,
that was very dangerous.

1036
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:39,125
Not so much tonight. Just us.
You and me, the kids, everything.

1037
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,950
I would do so again.

1038
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:49,544
I would choose you every time again.

1038
