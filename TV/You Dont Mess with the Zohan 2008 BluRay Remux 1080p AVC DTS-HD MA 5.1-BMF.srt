1
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,634
You don't mess with the Zohan!

2
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,737
Come disco.

3
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,156
No, no, no.
I no disco, I make the fish.

4
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,991
Danny, come on, go disco.

5
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,327
Oh, okay. Disco!

6
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,956
Danny, that looks good.
You're gonna be a hit at your bar mitzvah.

7
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,086
So okay, Mr. Big <i>Penachim</i>,
I no see you disco.

8
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,088
No, no, no. I making <i>dagim</i>.
I no disco.

9
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,258
A real man, he can disco
and cooking <i>dagim</i>.

10
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,509
So let's go.

11
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,766
Go, go.

12
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,102
I get the hummus for you.

13
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,646
And for you.

14
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,443
Little for me, eh?

15
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,533
No.

16
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,788
No.

17
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,831
<i>Kapara</i>, what is going on?

18
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,292
Just some <i>bullshit-uchen</i>.

19
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,377
Let's go!

20
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,465
Hey, I'm on vacation here.
Can't you see this?

21
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:38,552
You promised me time off.
Get someone else to do it.

22
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,017
Are they gonna hurt him?

23
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,311
No one can hurt the Zohan.

24
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:53,984
- Bye, Zohan.
- Take care, man.

25
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,005
The terrorist known as Phantom...

26
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,342
...was spotted yesterday
at a Hacky Sack tournament in Beirut.

27
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:24,056
{\an1}<b>NAME:</b> PHANTOM | <b>AGE:</b> 37 | <b>HEIGHT:</b> 6' 1"
<b>BOMBS:</b> LEFT-HANDED | <b>HATES ISRAEL:</b> YES

28
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,434
He may be have been trying
to bait us by surfacing briefly.

29
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,021
We believe he's being kept in a safe
house on the Lebanon border.

30
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,523
How is we lose Phantom?

31
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,067
Didn't I capture Phantom
three months ago?

32
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,278
What, you didn't hear about the trade?

33
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,571
What trade?

34
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,367
Zohan, we gave back the Phantom.

35
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,911
No!

36
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,455
What do you mean,
we give back the Phantom?

37
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,040
Zohan, relax.

38
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,460
It was a good trade.
We got back Etan and David.

39
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,380
That's all we got
for a veteran terrorist?

40
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:59,091
Come on, we got hosed here.

41
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,385
They threw in a spy to be named later.

42
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,721
Come on, Zohan,
you have to like that deal.

43
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,639
Maybe they're talking about Ze'ev.

44
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,225
Ze'ev. Come on,
he's not even a good spy.

45
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,562
He got caught, for God's sake.
He's a stupid.

46
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,900
Our plan is to enter the building
from the front with a team of eight men...

47
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,777
...with an additional 12 men
at perimeter positions.

48
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,781
Unfortunately, there is a high
probability of collateral damage...

49
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,577
...including property and loss
of life, on both sides.

50
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,287
Okay, here we go.

51
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,663
Excuse me?

52
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,125
Come on, is it not safer to send
one man into building...

53
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,586
...with minimal coverage
to take out the target...

54
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,922
...instead of blowing up
half the neighborhood?

55
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,465
Well, who would do that?

56
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,008
Oh, "who would do that?"

57
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,469
You know you were going
to ask the Zohan.

58
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:44,845
Zohan, why you say this?

59
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,182
I just laid out an entire plan
which didn't rely on you.

60
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,517
Come on, Yaron, you're setting me up.

61
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,438
All this talk of civilian casualties,
then of course I end up doing it.

62
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,775
- But I'm not even asking you to do it.
- All right, I'll do it.

63
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,695
Give me Avi and Koby as watch,
I'll get it done without the mess.

64
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,490
Well, thank you.
You didn't have to.

65
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:07,034
Oh, I didn't have to, <i>bullschlassah</i>.

66
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,370
Have some Fizzy Bubblech.

67
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,791
"Kiwi watermelon"? Yeah, is good.

68
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,211
"Avalon."

69
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,773
Chunky cuts.

70
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,277
Zohan, what are you doing?
The girls are here.

71
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,279
I know, I was watching television.

72
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,240
Well, if you want to have fun with us,
we're right next door.

73
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,118
- Good with the sticky, you should do it.
- No, no, no.

74
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,121
I am going to dinner with my parents.
Just leave me alone.

75
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,583
- All right, all right.
- It is all right!

76
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,586
You don't giggle at the Zohan.

77
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,547
You hear me?
No giggling at the Zohan.

78
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,091
You never giggle at the Zohan.

79
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,264
What's the matter, <i>tatele</i>?

80
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,267
You haven't touched your baba ganoush.

81
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,481
What would you think if I tell you...

82
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,941
...I want to leaving the army,
start a new life?

83
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,489
Why would you do that?
You are good at it. It's steady pay.

84
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,657
You can't leave,
you're one of their best.

85
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,951
Besides, you are too old to take a risk.

86
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,580
Stay in the army, play it safe.

87
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,416
There's other things
I can do besides war.

88
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,085
You don't war.

89
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,837
- I was in the real war.
- I know, I know the story.

90
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,173
1967.

91
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,177
We were surrounded
on all sides, outnumbered.

92
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,596
- And in six days, we...
- And in six days, we won.

93
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,391
You won. I'm sorry, I don't
have a big, fancy war...

94
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,142
...that lasted all of six days...

95
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:42,439
Six days and five hours.
Your generation likes to forget that.

96
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,237
Dad, I've done so much for the country.
When does it end?

97
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,824
They've been fighting for 2000 years.
It can't be much longer.

98
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,620
All of my friends served
the minimum three years.

99
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,331
Why can't I move on?
Do something else.

100
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,875
Something more creative.

101
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,710
Creative, what?

102
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,713
You've caught so
many terrorists, it's an art.

103
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,299
You're like Rembrandt with a grenade.

104
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,551
What will you do?

105
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,971
Maybe go to America.

106
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,974
What, and haggle over stereo equipment?

107
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,976
Wait a minute, Ya'acov.

108
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,812
Uncle Levi will set you up
at electronic store.

109
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:25,482
You make money, sow your
creative oats, you come back.

110
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,402
No, I don't want to do
electronics store.

111
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,654
Then how will you make money?

112
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,657
I don't want to say.

113
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,995
Zohan, if you can't tell your parents,
who can you tell?

114
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,497
Come, Zohanele.

115
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,421
I want to cut...

116
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,549
...and style hair.

117
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,058
You... You <i>fagala</i>?

118
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,352
He's <i>fag... Faga...</i>

119
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,984
I like hair. It's pleasant,
it's peaceful, no one gets hurt.

120
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:13,780
Well, you're only digging that
<i>fagala</i> hole deeper and deeper.

121
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:19,369
Hello, down there!
Hello, in the <i>fagala</i> hole.

122
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,039
Maybe he wants Vaseline.

123
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,585
Yes, it's so funny.

124
00:10:54,655 --> 00:11:01,662
I just want to make
people silky smooth.

125
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,424
You know the Phantom will try
to run, so be ready for this.

126
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,260
- Zohan, now!
- So let's go.

127
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,612
The Zohan.

128
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,832
Freeze!

129
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:03,974
I get it, I get it, you guys
don't like our country.

130
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,482
So we are the bad ones.

131
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,819
I'd love to sit and discuss this
with you, but I'm short on time.

132
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,071
I'm just saying.
It's not so cut-and-dry.

133
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,659
We settled here for hundreds of years!

134
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:23,994
Good point.

135
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,664
None of my ancestors ever stepped
foot in this land. No, you're right.

136
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,750
Hey, don't walk away!

137
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,337
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

138
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,422
Hello, jackass.

139
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:42,346
You think you can oppress
my people, landgrabber?

140
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,183
But I will never disappear.

141
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,394
No one can catch Phantom!

142
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,612
So let's go.

143
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,296
Very good.

144
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,995
Sorry. It's for the cause.

145
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,761
Zohan.

146
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,601
Zohan, bring it.

147
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,785
Why you do this? I feel no pain.

148
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,289
No, no, no. I feel no pain.

149
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,959
- I feel no pain. This is too much...
- No, no, no. I feel no pain.

150
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,669
I have told you in other fights.

151
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,338
No, no, no. I kill you right now.

152
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,637
Look, look, look.

153
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,936
The piranha, it looks
very painful for you.

154
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,855
Is good, is good.

155
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,149
Is very nice. Yes, yes.

156
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,485
Fizzy Bubblech for me.

157
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,657
You like what you see?

158
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,995
Time to die.

159
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,663
So let's go.

160
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,051
Okay, game over.

161
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,905
Yeah!

162
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,283
I kill!

163
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,745
I kill the Zohan!

164
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,580
Zohan is dead.

165
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,545
The Phantom!

166
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,496
Cutting the hair, this makes
something beautiful.

167
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,665
Instead of shooting it.

168
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,917
That's why I had to fake to die.

169
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,754
I could have captured Phantom again,
but for what? They trade him.

170
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,967
I love my country,
but the fighting, it never ends.

171
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,429
It's like Mr. Scrappy, you bite Coco.

172
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,972
Coco, you bite him back.

173
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,310
Soon you are both having worms,
eating your own <i>poopech</i>...

174
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,565
I understand. The pills.

175
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,276
Your parents think they know
what's best for you.

176
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,111
Sleep.

177
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,204
It's all about not getting recognized.

178
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:23,293
I know how great I looked in the beard,
but I'll make this work for me, you'll see.

179
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,977
Rise and shine, guys.
Good morning.

180
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,229
Is nice, huh?

181
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,814
It's the Avalon.

182
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:49,152
It says I care about the way I look,
but I'm still approachable.

183
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,697
Oh, you like this?

184
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,992
Who wants to go next, guys?
Who wants to look silky smooth?

185
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,203
Yes. Yes.

186
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,543
Oh, where are my two little babies?
Oh, come on.

187
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,838
Come on out, Scrappy, come on out.
Come to Mama, Mr. Coco.

188
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,551
Mr. Scrappy. Coco.
What happened?

189
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,762
Who gave you permission
to do this, huh?

190
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,514
Who did? Answer me.

191
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,766
Scrappy, was it you?
It was you, wasn't it?

192
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,685
You're always the instigator.

193
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:26,690
Bad dog. You are a very bad dog.
Never again are you gonna travel.

194
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,366
Take me to the Paul
Mitchell hair salon.

195
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,285
- First time in New York?
- Yes, my friend.

196
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,204
So, what brings you here?

197
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,872
I have a dream.

198
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,916
I had a dream too.

199
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,418
What dream you have?

200
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,420
My dream was to come to America...

201
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,631
...and make enough money to send
for me brothers and sisters...

202
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,050
...so that we all could
enjoy freedom together.

203
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,261
- This is good dream.
- Oh, yes, it is.

204
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,638
- Is dream come true?
- No, man.

205
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,224
Me brothers and sisters
were hacked to death.

206
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,978
But I love the Chinese food here.
It's incredible.

207
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,635
- Hey, you forgot these.
- Those are for you, my friend.

208
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:31,314
Good morning for you.
I am here to meet Mr. Paul Mitchell.

209
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,565
And who are you?

210
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:37,987
Scrappy Coco. I am here
to take a job from him.

211
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,572
He isn't in right now.

212
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,449
That's good.
So I will wait, then.

213
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,081
You know what? I'll take one
Fizzy Bubblech, a raspberry.

214
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,417
You know, he actually
doesn't come in too often.

215
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,295
Yes, just tell him I am perfect
for this, so let's go.

216
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,589
- I am the best.
- The best at what?

217
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,677
All of this. The cutting, the styling,
the making it silky smooth.

218
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,512
I wanna know who cuts your hair.

219
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,389
Oh, you like this, eh?

220
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,475
This is the Avalon, straight
from the Paul Mitchell book.

221
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:11,771
I haven't seen that style
since Luke married Laura.

222
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,691
Sister, are you this Laura?

223
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:21,990
You tell Paul Mitchell,
Scrappy Coco was here to see him.

224
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,202
If I find out he was here...

225
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,205
...or you are keeping him
hidden from me...

226
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,207
...I will destroy you.

227
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,626
Believe me this.

228
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:58,359
{\an1}<b>NAME:</b> SCARLETT KEH | <b>HEIGHT:</b> 5' 6"
<b>OCCUPATION:</b> SALON CLERK
<b>PROFILE:</b> BITCHY BITCHY | <b>ASS:</b> THIS IS GOOD

229
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,809
What the hell was this, champ?
I'm not paying for that!

230
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,270
This asshole cut me off,
made me swerve into you!

231
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,273
With all due respect,
I was in the bicycle lane.

232
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,859
You came like a madman.
Be glad nobody was hurt.

233
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,321
I mean, somebody could've died.
I mean, you came...

234
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,116
Okay, real mature, sir.
Real mature.

235
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,953
You do not want to be
throwing bicycles.

236
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,455
Look, stay out of my business, Mustafa.

237
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,792
"Mustafa"? This is not my name.
Who tells you this is my name?

238
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,086
Whatever.
Salami, bologna, apple sauce.

239
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,295
Apple who?

240
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,881
My friend, if I were you,
I would change the tone.

241
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,174
Avoid the pain.

242
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,678
Listen, go back to your goddamned
pretzel stand. We got it...

243
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,306
- Look what I've got. It's right here.
- Please!

244
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,975
- I've got it.
- Please, let me go.

245
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,895
I never work at pretzel stand.
You like to insult people?

246
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,691
Was that your feet?

247
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,651
Yes, it's the feet.
The feet uppercut.

248
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,320
Here comes the double foot.

249
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,656
This is good.

250
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,826
Smell it, smell it, smell it.
Now take it.

251
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,036
- That's for you.
- All right, let me go!

252
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,247
You said you wanted pretzel?

253
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,501
Okay, I'm good.

254
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,086
Beautiful.

255
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,713
You want some chickens?

256
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,840
No, no, no. I fix for you.

257
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,431
It's all <i>b'seder</i>.

258
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,683
What are you, bionic?

259
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,686
No, no, no. I only like the girls.

260
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,939
Thanks, anyways.

261
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,030
This is ridiculous traffic.

262
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,533
Anyway, George insisted
we have the party.

263
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,703
- I always get midnight shift.
- Could you keep it down, please?

264
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,205
I no sleep, I no see
World Series Poker.

265
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,541
Are you even watching the road?

266
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:22,587
Be nice. He could be a terrorist.

267
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:27,258
- Why Hamdi no get no midnight?
- Could you at least change the station?

268
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,891
- Hey, that was amazing.
- Oh, yes.

269
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,642
Where are you from, anyway?

270
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,978
Where am I from?

271
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,313
Australia.

272
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,565
Really? Because you
sound Middle Eastern.

273
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,525
No, no, no. Similar accents.

274
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,403
- Kangaroo. You see?
- Sure.

275
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,616
This is ridiculous.
We're getting out.

276
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,619
- Come on, dear.
- I've been working longer than Hamdi.

277
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,873
- You want me to get you home?
- No, I'll grab a cab.

278
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,958
You've done enough.
That was crazy.

279
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,252
Whose <i>lockzie</i> do I have to <i>schluck</i>?

280
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,215
Oh, you know you're boning me.
I don't know that.

281
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,760
It's you.

282
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,764
- What is happening?
- What's happening?

283
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,265
It's <i>bullshaklaga</i>.

284
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,767
- We have to go.
- Go where?

285
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,685
- I'll run you.
- What are you doing?

286
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,938
This is legal?

287
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,612
Scrappy, have another kneidlach.
Come on.

288
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,280
You're very nice, Mrs. Klayman.

289
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:35,201
It reminds me of my mother's
cooking in Australia.

290
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,871
Really? It's funny,
you don't sound Australian.

291
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,208
Yes, no, no, no. This is
because I am half Australian...

292
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,877
...half Mount Everest.

293
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,338
So this is what you're hearing.

294
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,592
Well, Australia,
it must be really nice there...

295
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,803
...since they got rid of the apartheid.

296
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,013
Oh, yes, the weather is much cooler.

297
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,893
So, Scrappy, I understand you cut hair.

298
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,896
I will be working
with Mr. Paul Mitchell...

299
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,524
...as soon as I find out where
they are hiding him.

300
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,527
Oh, Mom, Scrappy doesn't
have a place to stay yet.

301
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:10,778
- Really?
- Not yet.

302
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,322
Well, actually,
there's a nice one-bedroom...

303
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,867
...that just opened up upstairs.

304
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,661
Nice light, not huge.

305
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,872
And they redid the kitchen very well.

306
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:24,083
- This could be good.
- Could be good.

307
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,378
Could be good.

308
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,473
Hey, Mom, do you know
where the detergent is?

309
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,809
- That's very good.
- Oh, my God!

310
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,227
What? What's the matter?

311
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,646
What's the matter?
That's my mom.

312
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,899
- It's okay, Michael.
- I know it's your mother.

313
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,066
She's very beautiful.

314
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,194
Michael, I haven't made
sticky in two days.

315
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,363
- What do you want from me?
- Couldn't you wait till I was asleep?

316
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,324
- Or dead?
- No, Michael.

317
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,201
You do... What's he doing now?

318
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,828
Why'd that happen?
Why'd that happen?

319
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,496
It's okay. Let me talk to him.

320
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,332
Oh, I can't get up.

321
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,210
No, no. You'll feel your legs
again in two hours.

322
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,171
Michael.

323
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:13,174
Come on, this is nothing
to feel bad about.

324
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,426
Me sexing your mother.

325
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,554
It's beautiful. It's natural.

326
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,682
No, I didn't bring you home
to do it with my mother.

327
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,560
Why not, huh?
You don't want her to be happy?

328
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:27,146
Did you see her? Did you look at her?

329
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,649
I don't think I can
ever look at her again.

330
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,486
Michael, her face during
the big bang-boom?

331
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:34,820
You did not see?

332
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,614
She was glowing.

333
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,866
Patches. What are you...?

334
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,451
Michael, come on.

335
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,620
They'll be plenty of time
for you and me.

336
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,122
Tonight, I take you to disco, huh?
How's this?

337
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,291
No, why would I wanna
go to a disco tonight?

338
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,544
Michael, you should go.
It'd be fun!

339
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,546
You could use a little stank.

340
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,758
Yes, you need your <i>penachim</i>
to take a swim.

341
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,636
Yeah, a little chicken of the sea.
It wouldn't hurt.

342
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:02,098
Disco, disco.
Let's do this, Michael. Yes or no?

343
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,557
Come on, you get to disco.

344
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,060
- All right, fine, I'll go to the disco.
- Okay.

345
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,938
I do your mother one more time,
and then we go.

346
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,023
- Wha...?
- Seconds already?

347
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,900
Oh, yes.

348
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,033
Hey. Look at this.

349
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,412
This is what you need, man,
to let off a little steam, huh?

350
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:28,291
How many times a day do you make sticky?
Two? Five? Twelve?

351
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,669
How many times a day?
I've had sex once in my life.

352
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,547
It was at tennis camp.
It was awful.

353
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:37,967
You're too picky, Michael.
Maybe that's the problem.

354
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:41,304
Every weed in the desert
is still a flower.

355
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,598
Look at this. This a big one, eh?

356
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:49,145
But look at the tits.
These will bounce nice for you.

357
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:52,773
Your mother, she has huge <i>poopeh</i>.

358
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,484
I mean, very wide.

359
00:28:55,651 --> 00:29:01,240
But what I see are two big, strong legs
wrapped around my head, squeezing.

360
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,117
So who wants to get some <i>poontachen</i>?

361
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:08,706
- I wanna get some <i>poontachen</i>?
- Well, let's get some. Yes.

362
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,212
It's good for you.
Nice spinning.

363
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,760
This is what I'm talking about.
You play this.

364
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,928
- I ain't playing this corny shit.
- No, no.

365
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,264
I need to set the mood for my friend.

366
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,558
Get out, you Daisy Duke-wearing motherf...

367
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,071
- Disco, disco.
- Good, good!

368
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,947
- Disco, disco.
- Good, good!

369
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,962
Yes, hello. Hello.

370
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,049
Hey, Zohan.

371
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,759
Who you looking for?

372
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,720
It's okay, no one can
hear me in disco, Zohan.

373
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,098
Can you believe
the <i>poontachat</i> in this place?

374
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,810
I'm not Zohan.
My name is Scrappy Coco, my friend.

375
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,938
What? Of course you are Zohan Dvir.

376
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:17,566
They all think you dead in Israel.
I'm not going to tell.

377
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,402
Tell what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

378
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,406
Zohan, it's okay.
Don't worry, I'm a huge fan.

379
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,910
The way you took out
Abdullah Meda in '94.

380
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:32,790
And when you made Melami Benazir
eat his own shit in '97.

381
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,376
I can't believe I'm meeting you, man.

382
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,586
So, what the <i>fachma</i>
are you doing here?

383
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,130
Come with me.

384
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,299
Look, I couldn't take
all the fighting anymore.

385
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,885
- What's it all for?
- Are you crazy?

386
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,471
If I could blow a terrorist
inside out like you...

387
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,849
...this is all I would do.
I'd never sleep.

388
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,726
- This is exaggeration.
- No, it's not.

389
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:57,148
You made Palami Habdallah's
poodle sit on a live grenade.

390
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,568
- You gotta show me how you did that.
- I don't remember. I was young.

391
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,404
So tell me the truth.
Why are you in America?

392
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,614
I no want to tell you.

393
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,950
What? What? Come on.

394
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:12,913
You are the best, Zohan.
Whatever you say is good.

395
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,253
I want to be hairdresser.

396
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,839
You a <i>fagala</i>?

397
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:23,507
I can't believe it.

398
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:27,428
A great warrior, but also
a <i>fagala</i> with the <i>penachim</i>.

399
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,556
No, no, no. I like hair.

400
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,309
Come on, man, I get you real job.

401
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,228
You come by my shop tomorrow.

402
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,606
Israeli electronics. Are you crazy?

403
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,484
- Everyone will recognize me.
- No, you don't look like same Zohan.

404
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,986
You have silly haircut now.

405
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,405
- I have what haircut?
- What?

406
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,824
- You say I look silly?
- No, no. Who said this?

407
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:51,160
- You said this.
- No, no. Nobody say nothing.

408
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,913
I don't need your job.

409
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,334
I get my own job on my own
at a big salon. You will see.

410
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,504
You ever cut a sister's hair before?

411
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,592
Yes. Sister, brother, grandma,
grandpa, the whole family.

412
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,927
I'm good at this.

413
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,179
Have you ever worked
with dreads before?

414
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:15,559
This is what you do.

415
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,978
No more. This creature slayed.

416
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:22,107
It's not a problem. Okay, he's got me.
He's got me. He's got me. Okay.

417
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:25,319
Okay. So we blind him in the eyes.
We got you.

418
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,529
And we finish him.

419
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,617
You back away, I take hold of him.
Go! Go! Go out! Go now!

420
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,369
Go!

421
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,832
This is hair. This is hair.

422
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,127
Oh, okay. The joke's on me, eh?

423
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:47,549
A big part of our job here
is making this a fun experience.

424
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:48,968
Of course, of course.

425
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,846
For a lot of kids, this is their first cut,
and it can be very frightening.

426
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:56,183
- I can imagine.
- I don't want a haircut.

427
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,977
Get away from me.

428
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,354
Let me go.

429
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,899
Young man, look what I found here.

430
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,151
A nice balloon.

431
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,570
Do you want it?
It's right here.

432
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,948
You shouldn't jump around...

433
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,826
...when this nice woman's holding
a sharp pair of scissors.

434
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,372
If you move, she could slip and slice
your jugular vein on accident.

435
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,166
There's no way to stitch the jugular.

436
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,336
All of your blood will be
on the floor in four minutes.

437
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:28,340
I've seen this. I've done this.
You don't want this.

438
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:43,355
Well, then, at least it's a good time
to shave his neck. I would get him quick.

439
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,154
When I was your age
I already killed seven men.

440
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,781
Maybe you should grow up.

441
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:22,269
I promise you you won't regret.

442
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,688
And come back.

443
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,900
"Fujigawa"? I don't know that brand.
It really isn't...

444
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,736
It's not really Fujigawa.
It's Sony guts.

445
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,823
- Wouldn't it be better with the Sony...
- Oh, no, no, no. This is what you want.

446
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,077
- Four-hundred fifty.
- But the ad says "Sony," and "300."

447
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,456
No, no, no. What you going to believe,
me or the ad? Four-fifty.

448
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,794
Hello, Going Out of Business.
Can I help you?

449
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,088
Sony, yes. Three hundred.

450
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,256
Come in, yes. Very good, very good.

451
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:56,553
Hi. I represent the new
owner of this building.

452
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,306
Good for you. Want a birthday cake?
What do you want?

453
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:00,641
Yamaha is very good.

454
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:02,976
Did you receive our letter
regarding your rent?

455
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:06,105
- This I don't know.
- It's being raised to 20,000 a month.

456
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,775
No, no, no. This is too much.
Eighty-five hundred is all we'll give you.

457
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:13,028
- This isn't negotiable. We can get...
- Ten thousand, that's all.

458
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,363
We both go home happy.

459
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,241
- I'm sorry. We can't settle for less.
- Okay, no deal.

460
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:19,201
You come back when you want to deal.

461
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:20,953
- Sir, you don't understand.
- Go.

462
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,540
What you still here for? You like me?
I have girlfriend. Go.

463
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,834
Thank you very much.

464
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:33,549
Hey, look who's here.

465
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,967
Come on, not so loud.

466
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:38,679
Don't worry, Zohan.
I tell you, they don't recognize you.

467
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:42,766
Yosi. This is good man.
This Chocolaté Coco.

468
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,644
- Scrappy Coco.
- Scrappy Coco.

469
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:46,895
Cooking Who-co?

470
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,022
Yes, yes.

471
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,732
So you're going out of business?

472
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,069
No, no, no, no. Is just a sign.
Is good for business.

473
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:58,824
Yeah, so you look me up, man.
That's cool.

474
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,326
I come for job.

475
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,914
Job. So you not big hairstyle?

476
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:13,005
It's not really happening
for me so far.

477
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:16,008
So I am here. So let's go.

478
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,929
No. No job.

479
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,182
What do you mean?
You tell me to come here.

480
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,685
I can no let you do this.
You want to be hair homo.

481
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,605
No, so I do this for now.
It's all <i>yofi tofi</i>.

482
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,773
Is no now.

483
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:38,113
Once you start in electronics store,
you never get out.

484
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,909
Look at Ephraim. You see?

485
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,369
I don't see nothing wrong with that.
It's perfect.

486
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,705
Ephraim came to America...

487
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:50,626
...to be racing car driver.

488
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,378
But he let slip away.

489
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,548
I can hear it. Look.
Check your ear.

490
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:01,887
Pinchas wanted to be
the next Bill Cosby.

491
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:05,390
No. Is resistant, no proof.
You don't understand?

492
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:10,062
But the store kept pulling him back.

493
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,813
Maybe you swimming with the watch.

494
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,565
- I'm not swimming...
- Is resistant.

495
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:19,905
Yosi wanted to be a hand model.

496
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,991
What, you don't like this? Look at this.
This is most beautiful.

497
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,785
But he got too comfortable here.

498
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,996
Press this button, it's free HBO.

499
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:33,377
The electronics store
is a dream killer.

500
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:39,132
And I won't let the Zohan
kill his dream.

501
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,514
You are a real <i>mensch</i>, Oori.

502
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,059
You the <i>mensch</i>.

503
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,269
Come.

504
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,520
What? What's this?

505
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:55,440
You may not go for this,
but this place cross the street...

506
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,651
- Yes?
- They maybe take you.

507
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:01,655
- Is good place?
- No, is dump, but they take you.

508
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:03,949
Is on Palestinian side of street.

509
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,450
Palestinian?

510
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,954
No, no, no.
Look, nobody kill you there.

511
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,372
Here nobody care.

512
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,624
First off, no one kill me anywhere.

513
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:15,586
But Palestinian, no.

514
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,838
I've done enough to my parents already.

515
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,299
I just want job for the Zohan.

516
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,467
And it kills me the way
Phantom bastard...

517
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,512
...getting his <i>buttochim</i> kissed
in Palestine now.

518
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,015
<i>Buttochim</i> kissed? What's this?

519
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,725
He have business.

520
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,810
He buy wives.

521
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,479
Him?

522
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,191
They say his ugly face everywhere.

523
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,653
<i>Everyone is running to Phantom's
Chewy Muchentuchen</i>

524
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,240
<i>For the food the heroes eat</i>

525
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:48,660
<i>Kubeh, sambouesk,
delicious muchentuchen</i>

526
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,954
<i>You never know who you'll meet</i>

527
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,916
<i>You are going to get spoiled.</i>

528
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,592
<i>Phantom Muchentuchen!</i>

529
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,302
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

530
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,554
<i>This month, order
Muchentuchen Happy Lunch...</i>

531
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,849
<i>...and get action figures from</i>
Phantom Presents: Death to Zohan.

532
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,355
Unbelievable.

533
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:21,526
This animal gets to live his dream.
But, me, I...

534
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:26,239
I can no work Palestinian, no.
It's like... I can't do this.

535
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,783
Yes, you can.

536
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,870
Is your dream to cut hair.
You want fight, or you want hair?

537
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,290
I want hair. But I'm scared.

538
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:38,251
Is America.
You can do anything here.

539
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:42,047
You never done something
people thought was impossible?

540
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:47,427
So you don't want to talk, huh?
I'll make you talk.

541
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,323
I can do this.

542
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,920
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

543
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,797
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

544
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,716
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

545
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,342
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

546
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,261
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

547
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,932
So you have never cut hair before.

548
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,977
I have cut my own hair
and several dogs.

549
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:41,773
I have the Paul Mitchell book,
I have the stamina, the desire...

550
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,276
But you have no training or experience.

551
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:48,530
Would you hire someone
with experience in something else?

552
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,031
In what?

553
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,617
Can anyone here do this?

554
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,961
Okay. I have never seen that.

555
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,964
That is very nice, but that
is not going to help me.

556
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,592
No hands.

557
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,302
Besides, I have no openings.

558
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,179
If anything, I need to scale back...

559
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,848
...since they just raised
my rent through the roof.

560
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:19,603
Out of nowhere, some guy with a tie
comes in and tells me I need to pay.

561
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,979
Stop it!

562
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:25,233
I only wish to learn.

563
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,736
I will do whatever it takes.

564
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:34,159
Fine. You can sweep up hair
a few shifts a week.

565
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,328
- You won't be...
- No pay.

566
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:39,664
No, no, no.
But then, I will become stylist, yes?

567
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,458
That could be a while.

568
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:44,002
I will wait turn. You will see.

569
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:47,422
I will get nighttime job for money.

570
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:50,217
Soon the whole world
will be silky smooth.

571
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,561
Zohan.

572
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,356
- Carmen Electra has the best tits now.
- Oh, please.

573
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:07,526
Oh, my God. I wonder
how much she paid for them.

574
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,071
They're so perky.

575
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:14,199
You know, leave it to her
to buy the best tits.

576
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,827
It's always first class with that one.

577
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:20,163
You know you don't have to catch
every piece of hair as it falls.

578
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:24,709
Yes, I do. You deserve a perfect floor.
One single hair is unacceptable.

579
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:25,877
As you were.

580
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,434
Yes. I got this.

581
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,188
"Did you see the new
Kate Hudson movie?

582
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,400
I think she is even more
vivacious than her mother."

583
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:52,737
Scrappeleh, that's wonderful.
Now, let's practice on Michael.

584
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,074
Michael!
Could you come in here, please?

585
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,118
What? What is...?

586
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:01,246
Oh, Scrappy needs
to practice small-talking.

587
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:04,749
Can we do this another time?
I have a shot at keeping my food down.

588
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,501
Michael, I want to practice now.

589
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,588
I'm afraid I'm terrible at this.
Why won't you help me?

590
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:14,759
Oh, honey. You are good
at everything you do.

591
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,869
- Got it.
- Thanks.

592
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:43,246
So you're making her silky
smooth, huh, Claude?

593
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:46,625
- Framing her face?
- Yeah, Scrappy. I'm framing her face.

594
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:47,959
This is smart.

595
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,755
A nice layered style
with the soft bangs...

596
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:54,007
...is good for a bigger
woman like this.

597
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,384
- Coco.
- Takes the eyes off the moon face...

598
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,303
...and brings it toward the <i>titzim</i>.

599
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,305
Coco.

600
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:01,681
I need to speak to you.

601
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:04,476
In private.

602
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,146
Private. A secret?

603
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,690
They will never get it
out of me, I promise you.

604
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:14,069
Coco, Claude is trying to work.

605
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,862
Yes. He's very good.

606
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:18,907
So I am ready to cut hair today.
So let's go, let's get it on.

607
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,992
No. Let's not go.

608
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,160
But I am the best.

609
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,329
Don't tell me you're the best.

610
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,248
- I have the desire, the stamina.
- You've been here two days.

611
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,167
I run this place for five years.

612
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:32,087
I think I know when you
are ready to cut hair.

613
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,923
Okay, Jeez! Get a room, you two.

614
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,133
No, no, no.

615
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,220
I do not touch this with your <i>penachim</i>.

616
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,348
Out of respect for the working.

617
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:46,810
No, you don't eat where you shit.

618
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:50,438
Or shit where you eat.
Whatever the...

619
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,273
The smell is bad.

620
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,569
This is called a comb.

621
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,533
- With the fingers?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

622
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:06,496
- Scrappy.
- I'm sorry. Here, I take your leg up.

623
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,373
I'm sorry about this. I'm sorry.

624
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,583
- Okay. All right.
- I apologize.

625
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,211
- Take him where he wants to go.
- Thank you. Okay.

626
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,879
- Good luck.
- It will be fine.

627
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,591
- Your limousine has arrived, sir.
- You're observant, Tyler.

628
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,177
Thank you, Big Mac.

629
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:25,223
I am really late for a hotel opening
downtown. The Walbridge Hotel.

630
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,560
I understand, sir. I know the neighborhoods
inside and backwards.

631
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:31,062
- We will not let them stop us.
- What?

632
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:37,986
I'm not in much of a hurry.

633
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,742
Oh, no.

634
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:48,496
You want some coffee back there?

635
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,081
No!

636
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,750
I will lose them.

637
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:55,754
Nobody is following us.

638
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:03,261
Oh, shit!

639
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,485
Have a good time, sir.

640
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,533
Debbie, you did a good job.

641
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,079
You look very bangable, Mrs. Rosen.

642
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,332
Mrs. Paulson, I must tell you...

643
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:36,544
...when you first came in,
you looked hideous.

644
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,046
There was nothing attractive.

645
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:43,259
But now, I must say, my <i>schtitzel</i>,
it's about to burst.

646
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:46,137
- It could break these any...
- What are you doing?

647
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,057
We are talking shop.

648
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,309
No. No.

649
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,812
- Look, Coco...
- What?

650
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,897
You need to calm down now, okay?

651
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,858
I don't think these customers
like the way you talk shop.

652
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,151
Nobody say this.

653
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:05,657
Coco, remember,
respect for the workplace.

654
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,369
I have betrayed my salon.

655
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:14,999
He's trying to kill himself.

656
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,501
- Scrappy.
- I deserve this.

657
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:19,838
No, no. Just... Just...

658
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,757
Easy on the ladies.

659
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,510
I didn't mind.

660
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,517
Take care, Mrs. Paulson.

661
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,520
She did not mind.

662
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,568
Let me disinfect the scissors...

663
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:47,031
...so someone else can make
someone else silky smooth.

664
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,868
I'll just clean up.

665
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,041
Rafaela's Salon.

666
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,127
What? No.

667
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,423
Debbie, she quit.

668
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,967
- What?
- Sorry.

669
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,595
Claude, did you know about this?

670
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,054
I should have told you.

671
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,558
She's been looking for a new job
since those rent guys came around.

672
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:16,102
Then why you no say
nothing, little bitch?

673
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:21,441
Don't worry,
I'm not giving up on this place.

674
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,903
You're a good guy, <i>habibi</i>. I just...
I don't know what to do.

675
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:31,576
So let's go.

676
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,746
Scrappy, I have enough
problems right now.

677
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,335
I not the problem. I the solution. I fix.

678
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,670
But if you screw up...

679
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,256
I can't afford a screwup right now.

680
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,551
No, no, no. I no screw up.
I am the best for the job.

681
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,471
Yeah, but you push and push.
"When is my turn"?

682
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,264
I have to care about salon.

683
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,766
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

684
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:59,520
You care about you. And don't
fight in front of the customer.

685
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:06,903
Mrs. Skitzer, I am afraid
our stylist is out today.

686
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,198
Would you care to wait for Claude?

687
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:12,659
Does he do hair?

688
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:18,790
He's not a regular.

689
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,291
Well, that's fine.

690
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:27,966
She say... I mean,
only if it's okay with Dalia.

691
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,552
Okay.

692
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:37,517
You will not regret this decision.

693
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,731
Mrs. Skitzer, let's cut your hair.

694
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,902
Just lay back, Mrs. Skitzer.
I'll take care of everything.

695
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,738
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

696
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,700
Sexy woman like you
deserves to be pampered.

697
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,910
Me, sexy? Sure.

698
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:57,120
Don't be humble.

699
00:49:57,287 --> 00:50:02,250
You've got the ass and tits
of a schoolgirl and you know it.

700
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,628
And everyone else knows
this too, believe me.

701
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,338
Yes.

702
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,424
Let me get your earring off.

703
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,118
I love it.

704
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:04,163
Of course you do. I make you
silky smooth. I tell you this.

705
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:08,626
All right, Scrappy.
You can cut Debbie's clients today.

706
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,379
If they want you.

707
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,093
Thank you.

708
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,805
I'll get to you all soon as I'm
all the way done with Mrs. Skitzer.

709
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,641
That all you got, Mrs. Skitzer?

710
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:27,979
Come on, baby.
Go, baby. Yes. Yes.

711
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,541
So who's next?

712
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:26,078
Come on, Scrappy!

713
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,291
Thank you, dear.

714
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:34,837
- It's a lot of speakers.
- Yes. Yes.

715
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:40,426
It's orgasmic.

716
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:42,303
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

717
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:45,473
Oh, yes!

718
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,657
Grab it, Scrappy!

719
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,125
For you. Yes.

720
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,675
I give this to you.

721
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:32,019
- No. I am sorry, Mr. Paul Mitchell.
- Hear me out, Scrappy, please.

722
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:35,940
I'll give you stock options.
I'll name a shampoo after you.

723
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:40,611
No, my loyalty is to here.
I will destroy you.

724
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:47,118
I heard about this place from Joanne.

725
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:49,620
You have to ask for Scrappy.

726
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,790
Yes, is the primary cardholder present?

727
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,000
Excuse me?

728
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,919
Hello, I am calling
from Spiegel catalogue.

729
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:59,505
Are you between the ages of 18 and 39?

730
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,465
We're trying to talk here.

731
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,010
Have you ordered from catalogue
in past six months?

732
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,178
Could you get off the phone
while you drive?

733
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,140
Hey, what's the matter?
I trying to make a living, do my job.

734
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:10,391
This is your job.

735
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:11,642
This is job also.

736
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,852
This is not Iraq.

737
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:15,271
I am Palestine, I'm not Iraq.

738
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:16,772
And you're not getting a tip.

739
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,649
And you are a stupid cow.

740
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,859
Jeez.

741
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,612
- And we're done. Okay, you, skedaddle.
- Thanks so much.

742
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,156
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

743
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,742
I like this, the red hair.

744
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:31,162
I bet she has a pumpkin patch
down below, yes?

745
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:32,413
I don't know.

746
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,166
- Did you tap her <i>tuchus</i>?
- No.

747
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,377
Why don't you go after
the <i>snatchacheem</i> in this place?

748
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,629
They all want you, believe me.

749
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,757
Scrappy, I wouldn't be so sure.

750
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:45,259
I'm telling you, you're not
picking up the signs.

751
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:48,596
Come with me. I'll show you
a technique. It's beautiful.

752
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:53,184
Hello, Mrs. Haynes. How are you?
You want the cut and color today?

753
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:54,727
Yes, please. Thanks.

754
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:56,771
<i>Watch.</i>

755
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:03,444
You see? She's going with it.
It's good.

756
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:04,779
Yep.

757
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,115
- She has a free shoulder. Come join.
- I'm good.

758
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:11,702
Mrs. Haynes, you're getting cold here.

759
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,288
Claude, come. Keep her warm.

760
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,123
Go ahead. Yes.

761
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:21,462
And gently move.
Gently move the shoulder.

762
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,423
All you want to do is let her
know you're here for her.

763
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,635
Now look away like you're
not even doing it.

764
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:29,762
We're not doing this.

765
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:31,222
- Same rhythm.
- Okay.

766
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,766
Push. Push. Push.

767
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:40,231
Oh, you're pushing harder.
It's starting to feel good on my end.

768
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:44,068
I am trying to make money
to start my own business, huh.

769
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,821
Would you say you read Spiegel
once a month, twice...

770
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,823
Would you just get us
to the hair salon?

771
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,574
We're gonna miss our appointment.

772
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,328
I curse you, and I curse your hair.

773
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,873
What is big deal about this
hair place anyway?

774
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,002
They get worse every year.

775
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:14,306
Okay, we'll take them to the truck.
We'll just talk to them. But we'll find a...

776
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:20,938
Did you throw this
shoe at me, my friend?

777
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,441
No?

778
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,193
Sure looks like it was you.

779
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,033
Then who threw it?

780
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:40,583
Okay. You're lucky I'm in good mood.
I'll let you off the hook.

781
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,795
Nobody spits on me.

782
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:52,094
Thank you for the goat, my friend.

783
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:53,304
Yes.

784
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:56,640
Goat?

785
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,809
Goat.

786
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,479
Goat!

787
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,148
Goat!

788
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,485
Goat.

789
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,654
I said, "Can we have the receipt?"

790
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,366
Yes. Die in hell.

791
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,330
Welcome.

792
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:26,128
We'll color your hair Bling-Bling Blond.
This is what you need.

793
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,297
You know what else they go for?

794
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:32,301
The... I don't know what you have,
but mine is the biggest.

795
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:35,012
This... It does not
get bigger than this.

796
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:38,390
It's enormous. Scary. I mean:

797
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:39,725
What?

798
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,770
I have the biggest.
It's the biggest.

799
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:44,605
Take a look at this.

800
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:46,774
Look.

801
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,737
- It's not that big.
- It's not that...?

802
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:53,072
No, no, no. The bush.

803
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,366
The bush is the biggest.

804
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:58,035
And the girls like this
because it's cushion.

805
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:03,874
It is no <i>bullshaklaga</i>. He is the one.
I never forget a face.

806
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,709
So, what do you want I do?

807
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,128
Wait. I conference you.

808
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:11,215
Hello?

809
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:14,426
Nasi, emergency meeting.
You're on with Hamdi as well.

810
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,554
- Hello, Nasi.
- Hello, Hamdi.

811
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,098
Can you believe how much
they pay Delgado?

812
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:22,518
Yes. Why Mets do this?

813
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:26,313
This is serious. We meet!

814
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,149
I explain why is emergency.

815
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:32,111
This is not just man who take my goat.

816
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:37,616
- Zohan Dvir.
- Yes.

817
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,910
Everyone think Phantom kill him.

818
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,453
Phantom not kill him.

819
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:45,249
We will capture,
then make trade with Israel.

820
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:47,585
We will be heroes.

821
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,463
But, Salim, we are not Jihadim.
We don't know for sure that this is him.

822
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,550
Let's call Hamas, Hezbollah.
Let them handle this.

823
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,760
- Leave it to the pros.
- No.

824
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,304
Hezbollah shmezbollah.

825
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:02,349
Hezbollah will take all the credit.
This is our shot.

826
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,435
Why not let Phantom capture him?

827
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:07,813
Screw Phantom. He hero already.

828
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:11,692
Where's my chain
of <i>muchentuchen</i> restaurants?

829
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,863
Salim, don't make this about yourself.

830
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,489
This is about me.

831
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,283
And about him.

832
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,452
And about my goat!

833
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:24,747
Come on, let's go!

834
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:28,292
This is nice, the walking
inside the outside.

835
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:32,046
The park, the people,
the horses, the kid.

836
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,048
Well, you're always downtown.

837
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,300
You should see
a little more of New York.

838
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:38,469
Yes, yes, this is good.

839
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:43,057
The talking is good, to get to know
each other before the bang-boom. I like.

840
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:47,102
Oh, no, no, no.
There will be no bang-booming.

841
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:50,648
I just wanted to thank you
for saving my business.

842
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,817
- This isn't a date.
- No, no, no.

843
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:59,615
I feel you have helped me so much,
the right thing to do is to tap you so hard...

844
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,993
...my <i>schtitzel</i> will come out your <i>poopech</i>.
That's what I think.

845
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,163
Look, why don't we just enjoy the park?

846
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,499
No, no, no. This is what we do.

847
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,503
Hey, look, softball.

848
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,589
- You like softball?
- Of course, I love softball.

849
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:19,551
What is softball? Teach me how to.

850
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:22,346
I learned softball when
I came to the States.

851
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:25,057
When you're Arab, it helps to fit in.

852
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:27,184
Yeah, how long you move here ago?

853
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,269
Just a few years ago.

854
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:33,857
I couldn't take it there anymore.
All the hate, on both sides.

855
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,110
Yes, especially yours.

856
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,196
Why you say this? You don't know.

857
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,573
No, no, I don't. I read this.

858
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:46,120
The Australian-Tibet
media is very biased.

859
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:49,873
Look, both sides crazy.

860
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,375
My own family...

861
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,128
My brother...

862
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:59,717
...if he knew I work cross street
from Israelis, he would lose it.

863
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:03,470
- Really?
- You have the hardcores on both sides.

864
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:06,056
They just want to fight and fight.

865
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,435
Nobody will win this way.
It has to stop.

866
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:13,981
When will it end, eh? Yes.

867
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:19,570
Okay, so you must be thirsty, no?

868
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,989
Here.

869
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:24,158
Where you get this?

870
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,744
This? From specialty shop on West Side.

871
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,456
This Middle Eastern drink.
You know this? Fizzy Bubblech?

872
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,792
No, no, no. It looks pretty good.

873
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,837
Oh, try, try. It's very good.
Try, have a sip.

874
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,176
It's not for me.

875
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,261
No? Really?

876
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:50,142
This is his shop.

877
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,686
Here is photo for compare.

878
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,439
For how long this take?
I close the newsstand.

879
01:02:56,774 --> 01:03:00,360
Make sure you ask him
if he ever hit by shoe.

880
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:05,699
And about the prize goat that can
fetch a bowl of onion soup.

881
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:10,120
Look in his eyes when you ask him this,
for they will be suffering.

882
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,539
- You know, I just got haircut.
- Go.

883
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:18,796
Look at this. I feel like Hugh Hefner
with all you little bunnies around here.

884
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,803
Okay, okay, let's see
who is going next.

885
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:31,141
"Jorge Posada," where are you?

886
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,476
That's me.

887
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,897
Okay, good-looking guy,
you take a seat there. You're next.

888
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,025
You know, you look like you
already just got haircut.

889
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:43,153
No, no.

890
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,157
So I guessing you're looking
for something in the silky smooth area?

891
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,661
- Well...
- Because I see you have nice curls.

892
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:53,413
You don't want to cut into those curls.

893
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,499
We will talk about this over there.

894
01:03:55,666 --> 01:04:00,128
Okay, Scrappy, I wait.

895
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:02,881
Is not like I have a shoe to throw.

896
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,009
Sure. Yes. Beautiful. Whatever.

897
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:10,347
I don't have time to go
watch a goat fetch soap.

898
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:14,184
- What?
- What? I don't know.

899
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,769
Listen, my friend...

900
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:18,856
...you want to talk, it's good,
but you have to wait your turn.

901
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,191
First I have to cut
and bang Mrs. Greenhouse.

902
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,360
- That's right.
- Okay.

903
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,616
Well, I'm ready for it.

904
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,994
Oh, dear.

905
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:38,083
I am sorry, Mrs. Greenhouse.
I am not man enough for you today.

906
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,003
Oh, Scrappy, it's fine.

907
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:45,007
I don't know what the problem is.
I am going to lose business.

908
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:49,094
Oh, no, dear. You're still adorable.

909
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:52,014
The screwing was really just a bonus.

910
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:56,393
You are an angel, Mrs. Greenhouse.

911
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,396
An angel with a magic throat.

912
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:01,440
Oh, Scrappy!

913
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:06,153
No, that could work.
One more, please.

914
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,946
Let's see what we got.

915
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,115
And we're still nothing.

916
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:23,629
Well?

917
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:25,797
He was very cool.

918
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,966
Idiot. What did he say?

919
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:33,013
He think I have nice curls
that go well with a full face.

920
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:36,350
- But was it him?
- Well, it looked like him.

921
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:37,976
But hard to know.

922
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:42,856
I tell you this: he didn't seem to care
when I talk about goat fetching soap.

923
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:48,654
Soup. The goat fetched soup.
You ruin everything.

924
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,822
Soup? This makes no sense.

925
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,867
Screw you. It's him. I know it's him.

926
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:57,663
The goat fetched soup?
This is unbelievable.

927
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,165
Go to hell.

928
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,042
You said it was urgent?

929
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:05,420
It's an emergency.
Please, take a look.

930
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:07,756
Yes, yes.

931
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:12,594
Well, that's not a real problem.
You can always shave it.

932
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:15,681
No, not the bush.

933
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:19,851
No, inside the bush.
Look deeper. Him.

934
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,229
- I see.
- He lays in there all day long.

935
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:26,858
Maybe it needs some more oxygen.
It looks like it's being strangled.

936
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:30,612
So the Palestinian says to the priest:

937
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:34,032
"Okay, but let's skip the bath."

938
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,119
Why, are they not clean?

939
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,620
No, is good joke.

940
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,125
Honey, are you all right?
You've been in there for over an hour.

941
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:47,671
What is this stuff? I mean, I took one sip
and I repainted the whole toilet.

942
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,382
Is Fizzy Bubblech.
You'll get used to it, relax.

943
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:53,051
I don't wanna get used to it.
My car couldn't.

944
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:58,598
- All right, that's it for me. I'm done.
- What? What?

945
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,183
Is everything all right?

946
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,394
- Is it about the pee-pee?
- Stop it.

947
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:05,230
- The pee-pee?
- He can't do with his <i>peepeechosetz</i>.

948
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:08,900
Really? He's usually
as hard as trigonometry.

949
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:11,445
- Mom. What...?
- When did this happen?

950
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,739
The last few days.

951
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:17,117
Of course. It's ever since you
went out with that Dalia.

952
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:23,081
Your hog is telling you something.
She must be the one.

953
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,792
The one?

954
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:27,294
Is this possible?

955
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:30,130
Of course it's possible, man.

956
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:34,509
All the <i>beaverim</i> in the world
and he falls for Palestinian <i>muffich</i>.

957
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,888
Why should Scrappy care
if she's Palestinian?

958
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,308
He's from Australia and Tibet.
He's not Israeli.

959
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:42,809
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, no.

960
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:46,605
Exactly.

961
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:48,356
What was that, a motor boat?

962
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,775
You know, Scrappy...

963
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:55,071
...a special woman is special
no matter where she's from.

964
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,491
Listen to your hog.

965
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:01,703
Someone special.

966
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:02,996
Maybe is good.

967
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:05,332
It's good? It's terrific!

968
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:09,002
I mean, you know, you guys
won't be together anymore...

969
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:11,630
...but Scrappy is in love.
That's great, awesome.

970
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,924
Thank you for your support.

971
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,675
- Is a good boy.
- Good boy.

972
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,553
This is fun. Let's celebrate.
Where's the cat?

973
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,348
Let's cat-sack, huh? Throw it to me.

974
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:24,226
- Got you.
- Let's play, man.

975
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,605
Take it, Michael.

976
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,486
Look at you.

977
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:40,367
I wanna try it.

978
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:48,875
Is good.

979
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,129
<i>Welcome to Hezbollah phone line.</i>

980
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,882
<i>For membership information, press one.</i>

981
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,718
<i>For negotiation update, press two.</i>

<i>For terrorist supplies, press four.</i>

984
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,563
<i>We have currently suspended
our terrorist supply service...</i>

985
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,732
<i>...as we are engaged
in negotiations with Israel.</i>

986
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:18,238
<i>We will resume service as soon
as negotiations break down. Thank you.</i>

987
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:20,532
Great.

988
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:23,368
Come on. Just think of a bomb.

989
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:27,831
They say you can make bomb from
everyday's material. You combine.

990
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:31,042
Yes, okay.
But what we combination?

991
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:34,546
Just think of chemicals.

992
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:37,340
Chemicals, like in science class.

993
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,384
Yes.

994
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,726
Who remembers this stuff?

995
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,605
Hello.

996
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:54,399
Well, can I help you
fellas find anything?

997
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:58,028
Yes, do you have...

998
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:04,784
..."liquid nitrogen."

999
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:07,621
You need what?

1000
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:12,459
Liquid nitrogen.

1001
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:17,923
Yeah. Well, I suppose
we have some of that.

1002
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,382
Now, just a moment.

1003
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,934
- This is it?
- Yes, and that's the large container.

1004
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,811
This works?

1005
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,647
Oh, it works quite well. Yes.

1006
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:35,982
You use?

1007
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:39,611
From time to time. Sure.

1008
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:46,159
We'll take 12.

1009
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,080
Look, you can turn off the water...

1010
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,083
...but we will find a way
to keep on going.

1011
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,293
Oh, you like when I spray you,
Mrs. Skitzer?

1012
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,253
Where's the $14,000?

1013
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:01,758
I have your rent right here.
There is no getting rid of me.

1014
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,343
We don't wanna get rid of you.

1015
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:07,931
Mr. Walbridge would actually like
to relocate your salon in our new mall.

1016
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:11,351
You mean the one you want
to destroy this community to build?

1017
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:13,979
It is not our intent
to destroy this community.

1018
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:19,275
I'll take the community, Pancake.

1019
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:22,696
My name is Gray, and I'll be back.

1020
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:25,115
Nice to meet you, Pancake.

1021
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:29,953
Why Pancake?

1022
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:31,788
Just for fun.

1023
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,541
You were amazing right there.

1024
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:38,712
Oh, my God.

1025
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,922
What?

1026
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:42,841
I have one.

1027
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:44,467
What?

1028
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,137
I have <i>zikpah</i>.

1029
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,471
Look at it.

1030
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:52,559
It is you.

1031
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:57,397
Dalia, I don't know how to tell you this.
I cannot make sticky with anyone else.

1032
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:01,359
You are the special one.

1033
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,988
I will only be stiff for you.

1034
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,824
Who is Steve?

1035
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,410
Stiff, with an F.

1036
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,540
- Stiff. Stiff.
- Yes.

1037
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,751
Okay...

1038
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:21,921
...I know you meant that
in a good way...

1039
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,339
The best of ways.

1040
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,925
...so thank you.

1041
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,219
Thank you.

1042
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:31,181
Is crazy.

1043
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,684
This has never happened.

1044
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,436
One woman...

1045
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:38,813
...one <i>zikpah</i>...

1046
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,690
...one life.

1047
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:07,175
You see his face?
Scared Israeli son of bitch.

1048
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:09,302
Salim, this is not bomb.

1049
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:10,845
What you mean "not bomb"?

1050
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:13,640
It's grade A liquid nitrogen.

1051
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:15,517
Guys, I really need to go home.

1052
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,852
Inaz have a soccer match
in the morning.

1053
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:21,523
- I am hero.
- Salim, this not bomb. It just go:

1054
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,483
Well, just go with it.

1055
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,237
I scraped some off the window.

1056
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,239
Maybe you know what is?

1057
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:39,499
It's Neosporin, it's nothing.
I use it for cuts and genital sores.

1058
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,421
We're beginning to think maybe
someone out to get the Zo...

1059
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,423
The Scrappy.

1060
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:51,177
You mean like a competing salon?
That's heavy.

1061
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,264
Don't be afraid, honey.
Don't be afraid.

1062
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,141
Well, I...

1063
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,353
Yeah, lick this.
No, she likes the tongue in the ear.

1064
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,564
Oh, I like that bet... Oh, I like that.

1065
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,816
Close with the <i>brenski</i>.

1066
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:09,612
Come on, get some saliva
on those bad boys.

1067
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,948
- She likes it, huh?
- Of course she likes it.

1068
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,449
Okay.

1069
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:16,703
I could look for clues. It's my shift
for community night watch.

1070
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,621
The what?
The communism tight crotch?

1071
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,748
Oh, it's the community
night watch program.

1072
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:24,794
You know, people in the neighborhood
patrolling it, keeping it safe.

1073
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,713
We kick some ass.

1074
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,799
Hey, why don't you let Scrappy Coco
take your shift tonight?

1075
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,385
- I bet he'd be good at this.
- Oori.

1076
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,971
What? For clues.

1077
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:39,726
I know it sounds scary, Scrappy,
but you are gonna be just fine.

1078
01:14:40,602 --> 01:14:42,729
Maybe I can manage one night.

1079
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,647
Maybe you can pretzel some people.

1080
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,817
- Thank you for getting the hummus.
- The hummus.

1081
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,986
Where's Patches?

1082
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,905
Patches.

1083
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:58,494
I'm terrified right now.
I'm totally terrified.

1084
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,955
"Shitting my pants" doesn't come close.

1085
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:03,208
I wish I was shitting my pants.

1086
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:05,251
It's just a patrol.

1087
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:06,711
What if something goes down?

1088
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,088
I don't know if I'd have the courage.

1089
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:12,008
What if something goes down
and someone got killed?

1090
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:15,678
I would have to live with that.
I'd be happier shitting my pants.

1091
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,180
Much happier.

1092
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:23,394
- Let's go.
- We're supposed to call the police.

1093
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:24,687
No. No time.

1094
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,731
No, no. No. It's good.

1095
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:30,860
Drop the paint.

1096
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:35,365
Get out of here, Ahab,
or I'll cut your eyes out.

1097
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,034
- Maybe we should let him finish.
- No, no, no.

1098
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,954
What you cut my eyes out with?
The Neosporin?

1099
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:45,708
My blade, camel jockey.

1100
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:49,254
My friend, the beating I give you
if you stop the spraying...

1101
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,924
...is much less than the beating
I give you if you try to cut me.

1102
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,554
What are you laughing at?

1103
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:02,100
That was just with everyone.

1104
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,570
They had it coming to them, right?

1105
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,990
Yeah. Yeah, it seemed like it. Yeah.

1106
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:20,952
- Okay, you take it from here.
- I got it.

1107
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,495
Everything's gonna be okay.

1108
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,167
What you gotta say about that, huh?

1109
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:34,841
You're telling me
our guys can't handle...

1110
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:38,261
...some neighborhood
night-watching losers?

1111
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:41,264
We can't even put a scare
into these people?

1112
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:43,182
The main guy who got in the way...

1113
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:46,519
...is the same one who's bringing
old biddies into Rafaela Salon.

1114
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:47,895
My aunt goes there.

1115
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:51,441
She says besides the sex,
the guy gives a pretty good haircut.

1116
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,776
Don't talk to me about that dump.

1117
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:58,448
I've got a huge, classy
hotel standing there...

1118
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,117
...and it's staring
at that cheap garbage.

1119
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:03,619
I want it staring at the Supercuts.

1120
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:09,625
Now, has anyone made any headway
with any of these foreign people?

1121
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:12,837
I spoke to the manager of Going
Out Of Business again yesterday.

1122
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:15,631
I stated our price and
the urgency of the matter...

1123
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,801
...and he offered me two-thirds less
and a Toshiba DVD player.

1124
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:21,554
The people at Everything Must Go
were just as difficult.

1125
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:25,016
They offered me a Blu-ray disc
and a jar of hummus.

1126
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,642
What's hummus?

1127
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,686
It's a very tasty...

1128
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,313
...diarrhea-like substance.

1129
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,815
Grant Walbridge has a vision.

1130
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:37,278
A vision for Lower Manhattan
to have the first indoor mall...

1131
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:40,656
...with its own 300-foot roller coaster.

1132
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:44,160
You know, you're lucky I have
a world-class superhot girlfriend...

1133
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:48,164
...with a perfectly proportioned
ass-to-breast ratio...

1134
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,208
...or I'd be furious.

1135
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,377
She is smoking, sir.

1136
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,420
I'd pay to spend an hour with her, sir.

1137
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:55,838
Let me in on that.

1138
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,590
Well, thank you.

1139
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:03,846
But if you bitches can't get
those people out...

1140
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,724
...I will find other people
who will get the job done.

1141
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:09,685
However, whenever.

1142
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:16,234
Walbridge!

1143
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:24,992
This is where I find them.

1144
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,454
But I don't know if it's same
people who try to Neosporin salon.

1145
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:32,458
But you caught them writing
this crap, so, what do you do?

1146
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,463
- You don't mess with the Zohan.
- Check it.

1147
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:38,631
- Disco.
- Disco.

1148
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:39,799
- Good.
- Good.

1149
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:42,468
Why did you do this
to Naseef's store, huh?

1150
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,137
Why you blame the Israelis?

1151
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,180
We come to work,
go out of business.

1152
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:49,225
No, no, no.
Is not Israeli who do this.

1153
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:52,145
I do community watch.
Don't worry, it's all taken care of.

1154
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:55,690
Not Israeli? Who else
would write "Arab go home"?

1155
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:59,402
Oh, I don't know, just maybe
99 percent of the world.

1156
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:02,280
- You see what he says?
- That was joke.

1157
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:06,117
Come on, come on.
You guys get along here, stop this.

1158
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:10,371
Yeah, here it's okay. It's just there,
the war is never going to end.

1159
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:14,417
You know, we were so close to peace
before the asshole shot Rabin.

1160
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:16,919
Bush, he see the big picture.

1161
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,547
Bush no want peace, he set it all back.

1162
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:23,134
What about Bush's wife?
This is a wife I would get sticky with.

1163
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,428
I would do this. I would do this.

1164
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:28,306
- Yes, yes.
- What about Clinton? I would do Hillary.

1165
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,392
The big legs.

1166
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:34,520
Yeah, she look strict, like she's
going to teach me a lesson.

1167
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:38,774
- Yes, discipline.
- You know what's funny? I like Chelsea.

1168
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,568
You're crazy.

1169
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:43,446
She has beautiful legs.

1170
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:48,409
If I want legs, I'll take Obama's wife.
She has legs.

1171
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,661
This is what happens
when they talk politics.

1172
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,747
No, no, no, wife of McCain!

1173
01:19:52,914 --> 01:19:56,125
She has the ass, and you know
she's not getting any.

1174
01:19:57,335 --> 01:20:01,756
I understand my assistant
explained the job to you.

1175
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:04,592
He told us. You wanna get
some people out your building...

1176
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:07,678
...so you can build some kind
of roller coaster mall.

1177
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:11,098
Sir, I just wanna thank you
for this opportunity.

1178
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:15,436
I mean, it's a gift to mess with the Jews
and the terrorists on the same night.

1179
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:16,938
I mean, it's like...

1180
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,982
- It's like...
- Christmas in July.

1181
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,026
It's like Christmas in July.

1182
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:25,154
<i>Right now we are scheduled
to sabotage...</i>

1183
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,199
<i>...a black peoples' parade
in Chicago...</i>

1184
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:30,618
...but we can move that.

1185
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:34,205
Well, I'm not really quite sure
how you move a parade.

1186
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:36,874
That's easy, it's just a phone call.

1187
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:40,878
Well, we'll be calling back
to make the arrangements.

1188
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:44,966
Can I just say that I don't like most
rich people, but you get it.

1189
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,635
<i>We built this country
on the right to bear arms.</i>

1190
01:20:47,802 --> 01:20:51,681
Now they're trying to tell me how many
bullets my gun can shoot per second.

1191
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,601
They're trying to tell me whether
I can stockpile weapons...

1192
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,478
...in the shed behind my house.

1193
01:20:57,645 --> 01:21:00,231
- Right, by God.
- Anyway, you're a rich guy that gets it.

1194
01:21:00,398 --> 01:21:02,650
You and Mel Gibson.

1195
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:08,656
Mel Gibson. Not too shabby.

1196
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:13,160
<i>Welcome to Hezbollah customer service.</i>

1197
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,745
<i>All lines are busy now.</i>

1198
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:20,167
<i>Your call will be received in... minutes.</i>

1199
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,170
Come on with this.
How we find Phantom?

1200
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,674
Well, he probably hang
at the <i>muchentuchen</i> restaurant.

1201
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:29,343
Okay, but which?

1202
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,720
Probably in Amman.

1203
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,097
In downtown he get
the hottest <i>poochibaba</i>.

1204
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:42,023
What's the area code of Amman?

1205
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:24,440
Hello. Phantom Muchentuchen.

Yeah, yeah, I know.

But what about for <i>poonibaba</i>?

No, no, <i>poonibaba</i> at store
on 3rd and Lachalta.

1214

Oh, okay. So you have
number for store?

1215
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,299
You call information.

1216
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,885
You don't have number
for other store?

1217
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:56,722
It's somewhere.
I don't know.

1218

1220
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:08,150
When she is grown up
she will understand!

1221
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,445
Hello.

1222
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:16,784
I find the Zohan.
You not kill the Zohan.

1223
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:18,536

01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:21,580
No, you did not.

01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,752
Okay. Bring this.

I am bringing.

1228
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:35,553
<i>You see?</i>

1229
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:39,265
But the hairstyle, it is hideous.

1230
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,558
This is same Zohan.

1231
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,727
What he thinking? He look
like guy from <i>Who's the Boss</i>?

1232
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,147
Look, this is same Zohan.

1233
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:50,609
Everybody think you big hero.
But I tell everyone you not big hero.

1234
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,736
Okay, okay, okay!
What you want, huh?

1235
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:55,447
I want <i>muchentuchen</i> restaurant chain.

1236
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:56,782

But if I tell, you no have
chain anyway.

1238
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:02,079
So you not give any incentive.

01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,417
Okay. I want 50 percent

01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:14,925
I want yogurt shop attached
to store, like food court.

1243
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:16,427
Okay.

1244
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:18,512
- I get profits from store.
- No.

1245
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:20,181
- Some profits.
- No.

1246
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,308
I get free yogurt when I come to store.

1247
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:24,768
Okay. Within reason.

1248
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,478
And I want some of your wives.

1249
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:29,773
- Twenty.
- No.

1250
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,775
- I sleep with one wife.
- No.

1251
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:33,777
She give one pee-pee touch.

1252
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:35,696
Okay.

1253
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:56,217
My friends, look what I do.
I hook you all up with tickets.

1254
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:59,136
This Walbridge guy's trying
to kiss salon's ass...

1255
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:02,014
...so he give me 20 tickets hackyside.

1256
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:06,143
Very nice. Hassan, you see this?

1257
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:10,356
This is where you're going to be
when Israel kick your ass.

1258
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:13,817
Yes? No, you're gonna give it up
like you give up Gaza Strip, huh?

1259
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,821
Excuse us.

1260
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:20,783
I have to show you this.

1261
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:24,536
Listen to Fatima Zaad's gossip
column on Page Nine.

1262
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,831
"A hall of fame terrorist
is visiting New York...

1263
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:30,334
...and not for the <i>muchentuchen."</i>

1264
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:33,754
- Phantom's coming to the City?
- There's more.

1265
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:38,092
"He's coming to hacky sack
a certain scrappy Israeli...

1266
01:25:38,259 --> 01:25:42,513
...who says he cuts hair,
but really cuts terrorist."

1267
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,391
He's ruined everything.

1268
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,851
Why you say? You the Zohan.

1269
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,521
He come to hacky sack,
you take him out.

1270
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:53,232
No, I don't care.
I come here to start new life.

1271
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:56,318
Get new woman to love
and make the bang-boom.

1272
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,696
Now my life's followed me here.

1273
01:26:07,538 --> 01:26:10,374
Maybe Phantom no care anymore.

1274
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,931
You're an Israeli counterterrorist?

1275
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:09,516
- I knew it.
- What?

1276
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:12,978
Well, the Israeli part.
Because he's circumcised.

1277
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:16,815
How is Dalia going to forgive me?

1278
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:18,400
I'm liar.

1279
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,487
She Palestinian, I'm no Australian.

1280
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:24,615
You know, Scrappy...
I mean, "Zohard."

1281
01:27:24,782 --> 01:27:27,785
...if there's one thing I've learned
from all my relationships...

1282
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:32,122
...with Jewish men,
Puerto Rican men, aborigines...

1283
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:36,752
...you can't have secrets
in a relationship.

1284
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:41,715
You tell her the truth and if she
really is this special one...

1285
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,551
...everything will work out just fine.

1286
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:47,388
I like this.

1287
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:56,480
I am sorry I not tell you the truth
before I make you fall head over tits for me.

1288
01:27:56,647 --> 01:28:00,651
But believe me,
I am wanting you even more.

1289
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:04,405
I know you're not from where you say.

1290
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:06,657
I see how you look
at the Fizzy Bubblech.

1291
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:10,869
Then why you like this?
Is it because I Israel and you Palestine?

1292
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,579
Come on, tell me in my face.

1293
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:16,166
Zohan, you're not just Israel.

1294
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,252
You Israel.

1295
01:28:18,419 --> 01:28:20,379
But you say hate is stupid.

1296
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:24,341
That's why you run to America,
to get away from the hate and the fighting.

1297
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:28,053
I was even thinking we let
all this cool down...

1298
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,180
...I go out and get us
a house over there.

1299
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:32,975
We move in together, we cut the hair...

1300
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,894
...make the children,
cut the children's hair.

1301
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:38,439
Zohan, I can't.

1302
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:42,901
I have open mind, but you
Israeli counterterrorist.

1303
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,778
No, no, no. I no do this anymore.

1304
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,698
You put the fork
in the fat lady, it's over.

1305
01:28:47,865 --> 01:28:50,033
She's had enough to eat.
This is a promise.

1306
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,703
It doesn't matter.

1307
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,955
You don't know my family.

1308
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:57,583
Or maybe you do.

1309
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,042
What does this mean?

1310
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,045
Just leave.

1311
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,131
Please, it can't be.

1312
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,888
Maybe is for best.

1313
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:14,892
You deserve a safe life.

1314
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,395
But know...

1315
01:29:19,313 --> 01:29:22,566
...you will always be my special one.

1316
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:36,246
- Zohan.
- Dalia.

1317
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:40,334
I got you a gift.

1318
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:42,628
A gift.

1319
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:48,926
They come out with new book?

1320
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:53,931
Yes. They do it every
21 years, I think.

1321
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:56,266
Just a slight update from yours.

1322
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,982
No feathering?

1323
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:05,442
Or scrunching?

1324
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:07,486
Where's the style?

1325
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:13,283
But I know this is nice gesture.
Thank you.

1326
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:16,161
Goodbye, Zohan.

1327
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:18,580
Goodbye.

1328
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:27,130
Goodbye.

1329
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,824
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

1330
01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:55,492
Me too.

1331
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:56,952
You still go to Hacky Sack?

1332
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:00,080
Yes, it's better I find him
than he finds me, huh?

1333
01:31:00,247 --> 01:31:03,333
I got your back.
I get you best army guys in city.

1334
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,461
No, no, no. I handle this alone.

1335
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,265
Hello? Let's go.

1336
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:39,077
Go. Go, go, go.

1337
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:08,565
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here are your Israeli Blue Stars...</i>

1338
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:12,903
<i>...and your Lebanese Trees!</i>

1339
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:26,833
Fizzy Bubblech.

1340
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:41,890
What's with the cheers?
Wasn't that guy a terrorist?

1341
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:44,559
Yeah, people used to boo you too,
John, you remember?

1342
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,269
I wasn't a terrorist.

1343
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:48,689
You were pretty bad.

1344
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:54,695
I brought this great event
to New York to tell the world...

1345
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:56,822
...that New York City...

1346
01:32:56,988 --> 01:33:01,201
...loves its foreign immigrant-types
from the Middle East.

1347
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:07,124
My hot girlfriend and I know
that we can all get along...

1348
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:12,754
...whether you're white, or brown,
or khaki, whatever that color is.

1349
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:17,259
And here to sing the American
national anthem...

1350
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:19,886
...a superstar we all love:

1351
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:22,305
Mariah Carey!

1352
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,167
<i>Goal!</i>

1353
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,586
<i>And disco break!</i>

1354
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:11,104
<i>Disco, disco, good, good!
Disco, disco, good, good!</i>

1355
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:15,150
<i>Disco, disco, good, good!
Disco, disco, good, good!</i>

1356
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,154
Okay, Mariah. Couple more.

1357
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:22,115
This one's from Sheik Fayalah
of Lebanon.

1358
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:24,784
He wants you to write
"All I want for Ramadan is you."

1359
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:26,119
Okay, this again?

1360
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:27,454
- I know.
- All right.

1361
01:34:27,621 --> 01:34:29,664
MC, there's a Mr. Phantom
here to see you.

1362
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:31,958
Who's Phantom, a dude
trying to be a rapper?

1363
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:35,212
- Because I don't know who that is.
- He says he's a killing machine.

1364
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,631
Whatever. Okay.

1365
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:42,219
Miss Mariah Carey.

1366
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:46,515
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1367
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:50,268
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?

1368
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:53,897
Miss Carey, your high notes
are so beautiful...

1369
01:34:54,064 --> 01:34:58,485
...like a Scud missile soaring
towards its target.

1370
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:01,488
- Thank you. That's really nice.
- Thank you.

1371
01:35:01,655 --> 01:35:03,323
So you know I'm not dead.

1372
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:07,202
Oh, I sorry I startle.

1373
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:11,248
I was not startle. I saw a bee.

1374
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:13,875
There's a bee? I'm allergic.
It's not even funny.

1375
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:16,545
No, no, no. Look.
The bee is gone. He's gone.

1376
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,005
Mariah, believe me, there's no bee.

1377
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:21,007
I'm allergic. You know I'm allergic.

1378
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:26,012
No, no, no. The bee... Forget the bee.
The bee is made up, it's fiction.

1379
01:35:26,179 --> 01:35:28,515
It was a black wasp.

1380
01:35:28,682 --> 01:35:30,684
...promising me that there
was no bee here.

1381
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,519
There was no bee.
He says the bee...

1382
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:35,939
...so he can look more like a person
who would not scream like this.

1383
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:38,400
- Are you sure?
- I promise you.

1384
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:39,901
I beg your cleavage's pardon.

1385
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:44,531
We will be out of your bouncy
hair in a jiffy. Is between us.

1386
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:47,367
I was going to kill you tomorrow...

1387
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:53,957
...but I guess jackass
can't wait to die for real.

1388
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:55,792
Do y'all want us to leave?
Because we can go.

1389
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:57,627
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

1390
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:00,505
- We are not even here.
- Almost done. Give it a few seconds.

1391
01:36:02,549 --> 01:36:05,010
I came here to the States
to stop the fighting...

1392
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,220
...but I guess this will never end, eh?

1393
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:12,100
Oh, Zohan does not want
to fight anymore.

1394
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,768
Scared of bees, huh?

1395
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:17,147
Now I'm afraid of the bees?
I'm afraid of the bees?

1396
01:36:17,314 --> 01:36:19,441
What? You're the one
that brings up the bees.

1397
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:23,194
Your hair. Your hair
does not do you justice.

1398
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,697
You don't like this hair?
I think you're alone on this one.

1399
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:27,324
Everyone else going crazy for it.

1400
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:29,993
I like the 'fro better.

1401
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,453
Hang on, I'm getting a call.

1402
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:34,664
Michael, what is?

1403
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:37,000
<i>Zohan? We have a problem here.</i>

1404
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:39,836
- Where you get that?
- This is a Sony Ericsson.

1405
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:42,422
- It has Bluetooth?
- Of course it has Bluetooth.

1406
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:44,924
I can never figure that
Bluetooth shit out, though.

1407
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:47,719
Oh, no, it's very simple.
You sync it to your PowerBook.

1408
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:50,513
- Tell her. Phantom will tell you.
- Mac or PC?

1409
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:53,350
- Mac.
- You have MySpace?

1410
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,727
The record company does.
It's not really mine.

1411
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:58,897
Please, add me as a friend.

1412
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:00,732
Sure, yeah, yeah.

1413
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:03,902
Sure, as Huge Boner.
We'll add you tomorrow.

1414
01:37:04,069 --> 01:37:05,195
Michael, what is?

1415
01:37:05,362 --> 01:37:11,534
There's a bunch of guys and they are
lighting fires and it's getting pretty bad.

1416
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:15,914
No. Stay where you are.

1417
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:17,582
<i>Yeah, we'll stay up here.</i>

1418
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:20,418
- What? Where you go?
- I have bigger fish to swim.

1419
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:23,338
- Mariah, I love the newest album.
- Thank you.

1420
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:49,698
The Zohan.

1421
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,369
My pita shop.

1422
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:57,539
They burned it down.

1423
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:12,262
Why you do this?

1424
01:38:12,429 --> 01:38:15,056
We no do this. We at Hacky Sack
as much as the next guy.

1425
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:18,977
And I wish that we should do this,
after you write that shit on my wall.

1426
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:22,564
Across street!

1427
01:38:22,689 --> 01:38:25,191
- Waleed, Waleed. Look, Waleed!
- No. My store.

1428
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:29,529
You people ruined my store.
You people ruined my store!

1429
01:38:34,743 --> 01:38:36,953
What I miss?
I was stuck on West Broadway.

1430
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,748
The Israeli burned down my store!

1431
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:41,207
No, no, no.

1432
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:43,168
I save store.

1433
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:45,920
Then I kill the Zohan.

1434
01:38:48,381 --> 01:38:50,884
Phantom, kick its ass.

1435
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,385
Jab it to the right.

1436
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:54,429
Stick and move, Phantom.
Stick and move.

1437
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:57,640
He can't do this alone.

1438
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:02,479
Don't back down. Kick its ass.

1439
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:27,837
Phantom.

1440
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:32,967
Why you help me?

1441
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:36,721
Because I'm through with this.

1442
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:38,181
I no more fight.

1443
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:43,019
You do whatever you want,
but I no fight back.

1444
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:46,022
It's trick, huh?

1445
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:47,315
No.

1446
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:52,529
- Fight back.
- No.

1447
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:55,698
- Fight back!
- No.

1448
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:58,451
Fight back, Zohan.

1449
01:39:58,618 --> 01:40:00,829
Fight him back. What are you doing?
Fight back.

1450
01:40:02,956 --> 01:40:04,040
No.

1451
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:07,460
This is not fun for anybody.

1452
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:09,003
Why you not fight back?

1453
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:12,841
Because he know better.
He show you he change.

1454
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:14,300
Sister?

1455
01:40:14,467 --> 01:40:16,469
When you gonna grow up, Fatoush?

1456
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:17,804
Fatoush?

1457
01:40:17,971 --> 01:40:20,640
No, no, no Fatoush.

1458
01:40:20,807 --> 01:40:24,352
Is Phantom now.
And is my business.

1459
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:27,146
Is my man, Fatoush.

1460
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:28,815
You're my woman?

1461
01:40:28,982 --> 01:40:30,483
You Phantom's sister?

1462
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,569
You tapping the Zohan?

1463
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:34,946
You settle for a pee-pee touch?

1464
01:40:35,113 --> 01:40:38,324
I wouldn't say "settle."
It was negotiation.

1465
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:39,742
Fatoush is talking.

1466
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:44,414
Yes. I am Phantom's sister.

1467
01:40:45,832 --> 01:40:49,669
And, no, Fatoush,
I am not tapping the Zohan.

1468
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:53,756
But I think I love him.

1469
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:57,552
This is good.

1470
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:00,388
Of course you love me.
I'm very good man.

1471
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:07,520
Brother, here in America
we're the same.

1472
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:11,566
We just people trying to get jobs
cutting hair, driving cabs...

1473
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:13,735
...selling crappy stereo equipment.

1474
01:41:13,902 --> 01:41:16,029
- Hey. Is Sony guts.
- Whatever.

1475
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:21,200
The point is, we are thousands
of miles away from all this hate...

1476
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:24,037
...and we live together just fine.

1477
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:25,788
We do.

1478
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:28,541
We do.

1479
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:33,630
Come on, people.
Where is the hate? Anyone?

1480
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,965
- I resent.
- Resent is good.

1481
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,425
What? What do you resent?

1482
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:38,718
People don't like us.

1483
01:41:38,885 --> 01:41:41,971
Come on, is not easy for us.
People don't like us too.

1484
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:45,767
- Why?
- Because they think we are you.

1485
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:49,604
We do look alike.
You got to admit this. Come on.

1486
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:53,149
Waleed looks Mexican, to be honest.

1487
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:55,568
Yeah, he do.

1488
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,322
You know, ever since
the stupid terrorists...

1489
01:41:59,489 --> 01:42:01,240
...everyone think we are terrorists.

1490
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:03,326
Look, Bashir, no offense...

1491
01:42:03,493 --> 01:42:06,746
...but if you sat next to me on a plane,
I might want to get off too.

1492
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:10,917
He's right.

1493
01:42:11,084 --> 01:42:15,505
But how could I not hate
when you stole my goat?

1494
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:18,841
I am sorry about your goat.

1495
01:42:19,008 --> 01:42:22,845
He was a good goat.
I treat him like member of the family.

1496
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:26,849
- Really?
- Yes.

1497
01:42:27,016 --> 01:42:30,103
Did you rub his chin?

1498
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:32,230
Like this?

1499
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:36,359
Yes, sometimes for hours.
He would make face if I stop.

1500
01:42:36,526 --> 01:42:38,027
He make the face?

1501
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:41,072
Oh, the face. The face.

1502
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:43,783
That's it, that's it.
That looks just like him.

1503
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:47,620
As long as he was happy.

1504
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:49,372
Is good. Very happy.

1505
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,127
Holy <i>shichumetz</i>.

1506
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:55,962
I see what is.

1507
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,050
Those are cool.
Who make this?

1508
01:43:02,343 --> 01:43:26,784
{\an1}<b>NAME:</b> James T. O'Skanlon

1509

You see this?
Bastard landlord.

1510
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:33,124
He tell us go to Hacky Sack...

1511
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:35,960
...so he can make it look like
we burn each other's store.

1512
01:43:36,127 --> 01:43:38,337
To make us look like we enemies.

1513
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:40,006
This the real enemy.

1514
01:43:41,174 --> 01:43:43,551
I thought the whole place
was going down.

1515
01:43:43,718 --> 01:43:45,052
Oh, we're waiting on them, sir.

1516
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:51,225
We're drawing them closer,
like a fat queer to a dick sandwich.

1517
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:54,604
Aharon, get weapons from truck.

1518
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:56,898
No, no, no.
I wanna minimize collateral damage.

1519
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,941
- I do this alone.
- I do this alone.

1520
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:00,985
- We do this together.
- I go myself.

1521
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:05,156
No, no, no. Listen.
Come on, already, big guy.

1522
01:44:05,323 --> 01:44:07,492
Let it go.
We're on the same side, here.

1523
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,535
Don't "big guy" me, big guy.

1524
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:12,079
Look, you think I didn't want
to run like you did?

1525
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,373
- Is no pressure here.
- What?

1526
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:19,670
Listen, all I ever wanted since
high school was to go to States and...

1527
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:23,090
- What?
- This hard to say.

1528
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:25,343
Tell me, what is?

1529
01:44:26,803 --> 01:44:28,638
And sell shoes.

1530
01:44:28,805 --> 01:44:30,515
I love shoes.

1531
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:34,435
No. That's great.
I love to cut hair.

1532
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,270
There is nothing wrong with that.

1533
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:37,772
- Tell my parents.
- I hear you.

1534
01:44:37,939 --> 01:44:40,858
- They don't understand.
- Parents, they never do, huh?

1535
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:44,362
- Never do. They think they're clever...
- You guys going, or what?

1536
01:44:44,904 --> 01:44:46,739
- Yes. Okay, we go.
- Yes. We go.

1537
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:48,241
Come on, let's go.

1538
01:44:48,407 --> 01:44:50,117
Soup's on, boys.

1539
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,119
Hell, yeah!

1540
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,417
What kind of shoes you like?

1541
01:44:58,584 --> 01:45:01,295
You know, Rockport,
Ferragamo, the classics.

1542
01:45:06,759 --> 01:45:09,804
You should maybe try Hugo Boss, huh?

1543
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:12,098
No, no, no.
They always cover the toes.

1544
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:14,308
You stylist, you buy some style shoes.

1545
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:17,645
Oh, yes, but I'm looking
for function too.

1546
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:20,815
Try mine. It's Kenneth Cole.

1547
01:45:20,982 --> 01:45:22,900
Square toe.

1548
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:25,361
It is nice.

1549
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:27,738
This is a fashion but you
can wear to work also.

1550
01:45:28,948 --> 01:45:31,117
Yes. Hey, to be honest,
it's a little tight.

1551
01:45:31,284 --> 01:45:34,412
- Let me measure.
- If you could.

1552
01:45:34,579 --> 01:45:36,622
I'm ready for you.

1553
01:45:36,789 --> 01:45:39,000
Okay, checking the width.

1554
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,085
Triple E.

1555
01:45:41,252 --> 01:45:42,712
This is a big foot, huh?

1556
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:44,005
You win again.

1557
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:46,299
Is not a competition.

1558
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:48,467
I do need to cut my nails.

1559
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:50,553
<i>We don't know what set off this fight.</i>

1560
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,431
<i>It's apparently between
Middle-Eastern merchants.</i>

1561
01:45:53,598 --> 01:45:57,059
<i>- Let's get some insight.
- They is no Middle East. Is all fake.</i>

1562
01:45:57,226 --> 01:46:00,021
<i>Is the landlord, the Walbridge guy.
He pay...</i>

1563
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:02,690
<i>Excuse me.
Grant Walbridge, the developer?</i>

1564
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:03,941
Damn it!

1565
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:07,278
<i>Mariah Carey, I love you.
I love you.</i>

1566
01:46:07,445 --> 01:46:10,781
<i>I find you, Mariah.
I come to where you are.</i>

1567
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:14,368
I love you too, horny little man.
Buy my new album.

1568
01:46:19,290 --> 01:46:21,459
Zohan. He has a bomb.

1569
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:25,630
- And puppies.
- No.

1570
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:27,298
I'm gonna blow up this block.

1571
01:46:27,465 --> 01:46:30,718
I'm gonna blow you up,
I'm gonna blow up these puppies...

1572
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:34,305
...and we all going to hell together,
because I hate these puppies.

1573
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:37,516
We have no time. We have to make
the sonic power, quick.

1574
01:46:37,683 --> 01:46:40,645
- You mean the sound?
- Yes.

1575
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:45,149
But Arab and Jews have not made
sound for thousands of years.

1576
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:48,152
- Now is time, my friend.
- Thirty seconds.

1577
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:52,657
You can't do nothing about it,
Rabbi Towelhead.

1578
01:46:57,662 --> 01:47:00,122
No, no, no. Let me take
the melody, you go harmony.

1579
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:02,166
- Yes. Okay, okay.
- Here we go.

1580
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:31,529
Well, hello, stranger.

1581
01:47:31,696 --> 01:47:33,781
Care for some chips?

1582
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,284
Puppies!

1583
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:40,538
That dog is incredibly cute.
Did you bring that dog?

1584
01:47:40,705 --> 01:47:42,415
Barry Manilow used to have a beagle...

1585
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:51,966
Listen, I'm Grant Walbridge.
This is all a mistake and...

1586
01:47:57,888 --> 01:47:59,724
Keep it together. Keep it together.

1587
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:06,313
No!

1588
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:09,817
My life is ruined.

1589
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:11,485
They were perfect.

1590
01:48:11,652 --> 01:48:13,279
The ratio.

1591
01:48:13,446 --> 01:48:14,739
Why?

1592
01:48:17,408 --> 01:48:19,076
No, no, no. Stop.

1593
01:48:22,455 --> 01:48:25,916
What the heck are you doing?
Why you do this?

1594
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:29,420
Sorry. Sorry.
I got excited.

1595
01:48:29,587 --> 01:48:32,715
Okay, we fix.
We make mall, but this...

1596
01:48:32,882 --> 01:48:36,343
It's fine. Yes, it's fine.
We'll be fine.

1597
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,637
It's all <i>b'seder</i>.

1598
01:48:50,107 --> 01:48:53,360
Goat rides! Everybody, goat ride.

1599
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:56,030
The most wonderful goat in the world.

1600
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:03,120
You come. Come, come. Come on.
Come on, now. Give ride.

1601
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,879
I'm almost done.

1602
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:14,548
- I love it.
- Yes, of course you do.

1603
01:49:14,715 --> 01:49:16,634
I had fun shampooing your hair...

1604
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:19,970
...but I'd rather be licking
it off those melons.

1605
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:21,889
I knew he had it in him.

1606
01:49:22,056 --> 01:49:25,184
Yeah, he sounds like his mother.

1607
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:28,229
Maybe I'll bleach your nipples
and slap you in your face.

1608
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:31,565
- Oh, now he's gone too far.
- That was disturbing. Too much.

1609
01:49:31,732 --> 01:49:34,443
Zohan?
Can you help this woman, please.

1610
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:37,279
Of course, <i>motek</i>. You know,
if I was not married to you...

1611
01:49:37,446 --> 01:49:40,866
...this is the kind of <i>bootachem</i>
I would go all night long w...

1612
01:49:41,033 --> 01:49:42,660
Hello, Zohan.

1613
01:49:44,703 --> 01:49:47,706
So this is where you work?

1614
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:51,752
Yes, <i>Abba</i>.

1615
01:49:51,919 --> 01:49:55,589
And this is your Palestinian wife?

1616
01:49:57,591 --> 01:49:59,093
Yes, <i>Abba</i>.

1617
01:50:00,928 --> 01:50:02,680
Does she know you're a <i>fagala</i>?

1618
01:50:04,849 --> 01:50:06,267
I see. This is because...

1619
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:08,227
Congratulations.

1620
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:10,104
Now, cut my hair.

1621
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:12,523
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1622
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:15,943
I love it. Please.
